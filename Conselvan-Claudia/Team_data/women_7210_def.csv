The Rider 16 had shed some weight but I felt it rode higher than other brands I'd started wearing. Additionally, there was a stiffness to the ride that became more apparent on long runs, and I found the cushioning lacking in the metatarsal area. The 17's are well cushioned and supportive for such lightweight shoes. The overlays that were in the 16 are gone, and the heel is wider than the 16's, which may lead to sizing issues to those who liked the 16's and enjoy the traditional narrow heel and midfoot of Mizunos. I had to tweak the lacing pattern and butterfly the laces for these shoes to work for me. They may feel flatter to some because of the lack of midfoot hug, and Mizuno is using a new material which is lighter weight than the old midsole compound. Mizunos have always had firmer cushion than other brands (Nike, for example) and this might be off-putting to some.The 17's also lack the toe spring of the 16's but personally I don't miss it these feel lower to the ground even though the heel/toe offset is still 13 mm. They are quite a bit more nimble and more flexible. My suggestion for the 18 would be for Mizuno to lower the heel even further and provide greater cush in the forefoot area. Mizunos often work better for heel strikers than midfoot strikers like me due to the waveplate technology, and I'm not sure if there's a way to get around that, but the Sayonara is a successful Mizuno shoe that sports a lower heel than the traditional Rider."",""title"":""Big changes--many for the better"",""username"":""W.

I have owned and out-mileaged 4 pair of Wave Riders including the 14, 15 and am now my third pair of 16's. There are so many new features in the 17 it feels like a totally different shoe. Some reviewers I read noted it being a soft shoe, I found the opposite actually, and where the previous models felt like they were hugging my foot and cushioned all around, I felt as if the shoe was flat and the only cushion was limited and directly under my foot. I didn't feel the stability of the 16 (though it is a neutral stability - I feel my foot is supported well in the previous models). In the 17 my foot actually felt lost in the shoe and gave more of the feeling of running on a hard, flat surface - no bounce, no spring and no support. There is less cloth on the upper and the shoe just didn't feel stable on my foot. There is less padding around the ankle - which many say is an improvement, I am neutral on that point.Finally, there is a very visible change in the curvature of the shoe. Previous models of the Wave Rider had a noted rise in the toe of the shoe. With the new model, the entire sole of the shoe is flat. This is a significant change in the Wave Rider model.Overall, I had high hopes for the Wave Rider 17, but am very disheartened. The moment I placed the shoe on my foot I felt the significant change, running in them confirmed it. The comfort, stability (albeit minimal) and roll of the shoe is gone. It is a totally different shoe, quite comparable to the Sayonara which I have also run in. I really have nothing good to say about the 17, except that its release has lowered the price of the previous model, which I will be stocking up on - no intention to purchase this new model."",""title"":""Total Makeover - No Similarities to 16"",""username"":""Laurel E.

I went to a great running store (Brooklyn Running Co. in NYC) where the guy spent a ton of time fitting me, and ended up with these puppies.Yes, the Mizuno Wave Rider 17 is apparently very different from the old versions. But most of the bad reviews seem to be coming from previous Wave Rider owners! If you are coming into this new shoe/brand looking for something with enough support for longer distances that won't drag you down when you get to the last few miles, these shoes are great. I successfully ran that first half-marathon yesterday in them, with a time I don't think I could have gotten wearing heavier shoes.The only thing I think could be better is that the fore-foot could use the slightest bit more cushioning. Literally, even just a half a centimeter, or a couple millimeters! I tend to land more mid-foot, and it'd be nice to have that fore-foot support for push-off. But honestly, after running 13.1 miles, I hardly even noticed it. I sure am sore from the distance, but my feet feel great -- no blisters or black toes here!Anyway, I never write reviews, but I thought I would write this one in case anyone else (like myself) got nervous reading the crazy amount of negative reviews. It seems to me this just isn't the shoe for past-Wave Rider users. But it could be the shoe for a whole new fan base.If you can, try these on in a running store before ordering online. It really is the best way to see if a running shoe is right for you.(Also posted on Mizuno's webpage for this shoe.)"",""title"":""Great supportive, yet lightweight, shoe 1 of 1 people found this helpful.

Some reviewers I read noted it being a soft shoe, I found the opposite actually, and where the previous models felt like they were hugging my foot and cushioned all around, I felt as if the shoe was flat and the only cushion was limited and directly under my foot. I didn't feel the stability of the 16 (though it is a neutral stability - I feel my foot is supported well in the previous models). In the 17 my foot actually felt lost in the shoe and gave more of the feeling of running on a hard, flat surface - no bounce, no spring and no support. There is less cloth on the upper and the shoe just didn't feel stable on my foot. There is less padding around the ankle - which many say is an improvement, I am neutral on that point.Finally, there is a very visible change in the curvature of the shoe. Previous models of the Wave Rider had a noted rise in the toe of the shoe. With the new model, the entire sole of the shoe is flat. This is a significant change in the Wave Rider model.Overall, I had high hopes for the Wave Rider 17, but am very disheartened. The moment I placed the shoe on my foot I felt the significant change, running in them confirmed it. The comfort, stability (albeit minimal) and roll of the shoe is gone. It is a totally different shoe, quite comparable to the Sayonara which I have also run in.

The Rider 16 had shed some weight but I felt it rode higher than other brands I'd started wearing. Additionally, there was a stiffness to the ride that became more apparent on long runs, and I found the cushioning lacking in the metatarsal area. The 17's are well cushioned and supportive for such lightweight shoes. The overlays that were in the 16 are gone, and the heel is wider than the 16's, which may lead to sizing issues to those who liked the 16's and enjoy the traditional narrow heel and midfoot of Mizunos. I had to tweak the lacing pattern and butterfly the laces for these shoes to work for me. They may feel flatter to some because of the lack of midfoot hug, and Mizuno is using a new material which is lighter weight than the old midsole compound. Mizunos have always had firmer cushion than other brands (Nike, for example) and this might be off-putting to some.The 17's also lack the toe spring of the 16's but personally I don't miss it these feel lower to the ground even though the heel/toe offset is still 13 mm. They are quite a bit more nimble and more flexible. My suggestion for the 18 would be for Mizuno to lower the heel even further and provide greater cush in the forefoot area. Mizunos often work better for heel strikers than midfoot strikers like me due to the waveplate technology, and I'm not sure if there's a way to get around that, but the Sayonara is a successful Mizuno shoe that sports a lower heel than the traditional Rider."",""title"":""Big changes--many for the better"",""username"":""W.

I went to a great running store (Brooklyn Running Co. in NYC) where the guy spent a ton of time fitting me, and ended up with these puppies.Yes, the Mizuno Wave Rider 17 is apparently very different from the old versions. But most of the bad reviews seem to be coming from previous Wave Rider owners! If you are coming into this new shoe/brand looking for something with enough support for longer distances that won't drag you down when you get to the last few miles, these shoes are great. I successfully ran that first half-marathon yesterday in them, with a time I don't think I could have gotten wearing heavier shoes.The only thing I think could be better is that the fore-foot could use the slightest bit more cushioning. Literally, even just a half a centimeter, or a couple millimeters! I tend to land more mid-foot, and it'd be nice to have that fore-foot support for push-off. But honestly, after running 13.1 miles, I hardly even noticed it. I sure am sore from the distance, but my feet feel great -- no blisters or black toes here!Anyway, I never write reviews, but I thought I would write this one in case anyone else (like myself) got nervous reading the crazy amount of negative reviews. It seems to me this just isn't the shoe for past-Wave Rider users. But it could be the shoe for a whole new fan base.If you can, try these on in a running store before ordering online. It really is the best way to see if a running shoe is right for you.(Also posted on Mizuno's webpage for this shoe.)"",""title"":""Great supportive, yet lightweight, shoe 1 of 1 people found this helpful.

I didn't feel the stability of the 16 (though it is a neutral stability - I feel my foot is supported well in the previous models). In the 17 my foot actually felt lost in the shoe and gave more of the feeling of running on a hard, flat surface - no bounce, no spring and no support.

There is less padding around the ankle - which many say is an improvement, I am neutral on that point.Finally, there is a very visible change in the curvature of the shoe.

The moment I placed the shoe on my foot I felt the significant change, running in them confirmed it. The comfort, stability (albeit minimal) and roll of the shoe is gone.

The Rider 16 had shed some weight but I felt it rode higher than other brands I'd started wearing. Additionally, there was a stiffness to the ride that became more apparent on long runs, and I found the cushioning lacking in the metatarsal area. The 17's are well cushioned and supportive for such lightweight shoes.

I had to tweak the lacing pattern and butterfly the laces for these shoes to work for me. They may feel flatter to some because of the lack of midfoot hug, and Mizuno is using a new material which is lighter weight than the old midsole compound. Mizunos have always had firmer cushion than other brands (Nike, for example) and this might be off-putting to some.The 17's also lack the toe spring of the 16's but personally I don't miss it these feel lower to the ground even though the heel/toe offset is still 13 mm.

I went to a great running store (Brooklyn Running Co. in NYC) where the guy spent a ton of time fitting me, and ended up with these puppies.Yes, the Mizuno Wave Rider 17 is apparently very different from the old versions. But most of the bad reviews seem to be coming from previous Wave Rider owners! If you are coming into this new shoe/brand looking for something with enough support for longer distances that won't drag you down when you get to the last few miles, these shoes are great. I successfully ran that first half-marathon yesterday in them, with a time I don't think I could have gotten wearing heavier shoes.The only thing I think could be better is that the fore-foot could use the slightest bit more cushioning. Literally, even just a half a centimeter, or a couple millimeters! I tend to land more mid-foot, and it'd be nice to have that fore-foot support for push-off. But honestly, after running 13.1 miles, I hardly even noticed it. I sure am sore from the distance, but my feet feel great -- no blisters or black toes here!Anyway, I never write reviews, but I thought I would write this one in case anyone else (like myself) got nervous reading the crazy amount of negative reviews. It seems to me this just isn't the shoe for past-Wave Rider users. But it could be the shoe for a whole new fan base.If you can, try these on in a running store before ordering online.

Mizunos often work better for heel strikers than midfoot strikers like me due to the waveplate technology, and I'm not sure if there's a way to get around that, but the Sayonara is a successful Mizuno shoe that sports a lower heel than the traditional Rider."",""title"":""Big changes--many for the better 43 of 44 people found this helpful.

There is less padding around the ankle - which many say is an improvement, I am neutral on that point.Finally, there is a very visible change in the curvature of the shoe.

I went to a great running store (Brooklyn Running Co. in NYC) where the guy spent a ton of time fitting me, and ended up with these puppies.Yes, the Mizuno Wave Rider 17 is apparently very different from the old versions. But most of the bad reviews seem to be coming from previous Wave Rider owners! If you are coming into this new shoe/brand looking for something with enough support for longer distances that won't drag you down when you get to the last few miles, these shoes are great. I successfully ran that first half-marathon yesterday in them, with a time I don't think I could have gotten wearing heavier shoes.The only thing I think could be better is that the fore-foot could use the slightest bit more cushioning. Literally, even just a half a centimeter, or a couple millimeters! I tend to land more mid-foot, and it'd be nice to have that fore-foot support for push-off. But honestly, after running 13.1 miles, I hardly even noticed it. I sure am sore from the distance, but my feet feel great -- no blisters or black toes here!Anyway, I never write reviews, but I thought I would write this one in case anyone else (like myself) got nervous reading the crazy amount of negative reviews. It seems to me this just isn't the shoe for past-Wave Rider users. But it could be the shoe for a whole new fan base.If you can, try these on in a running store before ordering online.

Mizunos have always had firmer cushion than other brands (Nike, for example) and this might be off-putting to some.The 17's also lack the toe spring of the 16's but personally I don't miss it these feel lower to the ground even though the heel/toe offset is still 13 mm. They are quite a bit more nimble and more flexible. My suggestion for the 18 would be for Mizuno to lower the heel even further and provide greater cush in the forefoot area. Mizunos often work better for heel strikers than midfoot strikers like me due to the waveplate technology, and I'm not sure if there's a way to get around that, but the Sayonara is a successful Mizuno shoe that sports a lower heel than the traditional Rider."",""title"":""Big changes--many for the better 43 of 44 people found this helpful.

I have owned and out-mileaged 4 pair of Wave Riders including the 14, 15 and am now my third pair of 16's. There are so many new features in the 17 it feels like a totally different shoe. Some reviewers I read noted it being a soft shoe, I found the opposite actually, and where the previous models felt like they were hugging my foot and cushioned all around, I felt as if the shoe was flat and the only cushion was limited and directly under my foot. I didn't feel the stability of the 16 (though it is a neutral stability - I feel my foot is supported well in the previous models). In the 17 my foot actually felt lost in the shoe and gave more of the feeling of running on a hard, flat surface - no bounce, no spring and no support. There is less cloth on the upper and the shoe just didn't feel stable on my foot. There is less padding around the ankle - which many say is an improvement, I am neutral on that point.Finally, there is a very visible change in the curvature of the shoe. Previous models of the Wave Rider had a noted rise in the toe of the shoe. With the new model, the entire sole of the shoe is flat. This is a significant change in the Wave Rider model.Overall, I had high hopes for the Wave Rider 17, but am very disheartened. The moment I placed the shoe on my foot I felt the significant change, running in them confirmed it. The comfort, stability (albeit minimal) and roll of the shoe is gone. It is a totally different shoe, quite comparable to the Sayonara which I have also run in. I really have nothing good to say about the 17, except that its release has lowered the price of the previous model, which I will be stocking up on - no intention to purchase this new model."",""title"":""Total Makeover - No Similarities to 16 67 of 70 people found this helpful.

That doesn't mean the 2015 style is bad by any means actually there are a few really great changes. Just for background for you runners out there: I have normal arches that collapse a bit. I have a normal/slightly supinated stride and tend to toe-in a little bit on one foot.Good news: This new 2015 style doesn't have the annoying ankle seam that the 2014 style had. This makes the 2015 version better for walking because you won't experience the ankle chafing that the former style had. You can wear tabbed socks and low-cut socks with the 2015 version. The colors and pattern are really cool looking. The fabric itself is thicker, but has a slightly looser fit than the 2014 version. I find myself actually using the shoelaces to tighten the shoe. Overall, if you're looking for a street shoe or you run mostly 5k and 10k distance, you will still love this shoe.Now the bad news: The 2015 shoe is not good for long-distance training. Anything over 10 miles is going to hurt. It took me a long time to pinpoint why I didn't like the 2015 version because the soles look very similar, but after several long-distance runs, I think I figured it out. The insole is less cushioned and doesn't wrap around the foot as much. Also, if you compare 2014 shoe to 2015 shoe, you'll see that there is slightly less heel and forefoot cushion in the new model. It doesn't look very different, but it makes a huge difference for full marathon training. The 2014 version was my go-to marathon shoe, so I'm sad about the changes Nike implemented to make this new version more responsive.

That was more than 10 years ago and I have literally worn them out! Now I live in Washington where it still gets cold and wet and sometimes snowy, too, so I am excited to have a new pair on the way, in the same style as my old friends. My feet can't wait! I have everything positive to say about these slippers and no negatives. One caution: I have large feet for a woman (wide and high instep). My first pair took awhile to break in and fit really comfortably so this time I measured as instructed, found I am actually in between on a half size, so went up to the next full size. I recommend this for anyone with wide feet or a high instep.

The clogs are good when you are on your feet a lot, but not really for long-distance walking. I was hoping the lace-ups would provide a little more over-all support and be shoes I could take on walking tours and things like that. Nope. The arch support is there, but there isn't much cushioning. They are still softer than Dansko shoes, but nothing like the wonderful cushioning in the other Klog styles. So I had to send them back.

Next time I will order a regular size 7 without the wider style and perhaps I will have a perfect fit I do love Gravity Defyer because of the bounciness and no more foot pain upon waking after a hard work out. They do take out the impact from jumping and walking. My knees are thankful as is my lower back. This is my third pair and I do highly recommend them. Other brands are plastic, narrow and say they have 'air' but I believe its a gimmick. Ive had my share of sneakers and I love these. Saw them in an AARP magazine, thought they were for old folks (I'm 50 something) and now I see them everywhere. I got 2 pairs for the price of one Nike for 200 and more pleased, no rubbing, blisters, foot pain and I enjoy working out to my fullest. Where have you been all these years I know I could have exchanged them without any hassle, ( try and do that at Champs!) but hey, a little extra width is ok for those days I may swell with heat, winter with good thick socks etc so I look forward to buying more each and every year.

Next time I will order a regular size 7 without the wider style and perhaps I will have a perfect fit I do love Gravity Defyer because of the bounciness and no more foot pain upon waking after a hard work out. They do take out the impact from jumping and walking. My knees are thankful as is my lower back. This is my third pair and I do highly recommend them. Other brands are plastic, narrow and say they have 'air' but I believe its a gimmick. Ive had my share of sneakers and I love these. Saw them in an AARP magazine, thought they were for old folks (I'm 50 something) and now I see them everywhere. I got 2 pairs for the price of one Nike for 200 and more pleased, no rubbing, blisters, foot pain and I enjoy working out to my fullest.

Next time I will order a regular size 7 without the wider style and perhaps I will have a perfect fit I do love Gravity Defyer because of the bounciness and no more foot pain upon waking after a hard work out. They do take out the impact from jumping and walking. My knees are thankful as is my lower back. This is my third pair and I do highly recommend them. Other brands are plastic, narrow and say they have 'air' but I believe its a gimmick. Ive had my share of sneakers and I love these. Saw them in an AARP magazine, thought they were for old folks (I'm 50 something) and now I see them everywhere. I got 2 pairs for the price of one Nike for 200 and more pleased, no rubbing, blisters, foot pain and I enjoy working out to my fullest.

Next time I will order a regular size 7 without the wider style and perhaps I will have a perfect fit I do love Gravity Defyer because of the bounciness and no more foot pain upon waking after a hard work out. They do take out the impact from jumping and walking. My knees are thankful as is my lower back. This is my third pair and I do highly recommend them. Other brands are plastic, narrow and say they have 'air' but I believe its a gimmick. Ive had my share of sneakers and I love these. Saw them in an AARP magazine, thought they were for old folks (I'm 50 something) and now I see them everywhere. I got 2 pairs for the price of one Nike for 200 and more pleased, no rubbing, blisters, foot pain and I enjoy working out to my fullest.

Next time I will order a regular size 7 without the wider style and perhaps I will have a perfect fit I do love Gravity Defyer because of the bounciness and no more foot pain upon waking after a hard work out. They do take out the impact from jumping and walking. My knees are thankful as is my lower back. This is my third pair and I do highly recommend them. Other brands are plastic, narrow and say they have 'air' but I believe its a gimmick. Ive had my share of sneakers and I love these. Saw them in an AARP magazine, thought they were for old folks (I'm 50 something) and now I see them everywhere. I got 2 pairs for the price of one Nike for 200 and more pleased, no rubbing, blisters, foot pain and I enjoy working out to my fullest. Where have you been all these years I know I could have exchanged them without any hassle, ( try and do that at Champs!) but hey, a little extra width is ok for those days I may swell with heat, winter with good thick socks etc so I look forward to buying more each and every year.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I have a foot on the thinner side and really wear an 11 but ordered the 12 because I don't like heel hang. The narrow is perfect and the length is great. I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I wear with thick socks in winter and no socks in spring and either way they fit great. I would even suggest ordering a half size up if you plan on wearing with thick socks, just to give yourself extra toe room, with no heel overhang.

I am a sixty-two year old woman who walks 5-7 miles daily, sometimes a little more and occasionally a little less (if my feet are aching). I tend to get a few more aches and pains than when I was younger and sometimes I get aches and pains in my feet, probably because I walk so much. I have had a few broken bones in my feet and wrists, but no really severe broken bones, so I am not sure if that is a contributing factor, or just that I am getting older and walk so much. Some mornings I do wake up with stiffness in my hands, so I may have some minor arthritis due to having had broken bones in the past. I had been wearing the Merrell Moab shoes, which worked well for a while, though they were heavy. Then, I got a knot on the bottom of my foot in the arch area and also a pain on the top of my foot down the left side. I decided to go back to a lighter pair of shoes. In the past I had worn some very lightweight Merrell running shoes which were very comfortable, but I did tend to get a callous area on the outer edge of one of my feet on the side where my little toe is. I went to Dick's and saw the Nike Flyknit 4.0 shoes and tried them on and instantly loved them. The knit material on the top of the shoe hugs and conforms to your foot giving support but is not at all constrictive. Nowhere does the shoe rub against the skin so it is a shoe that is not blister causing.

I have pretty square feet (my toes don't taper as much from the big toe to the littlest) and my foot is slightly wide/high volume, so this sometimes makes some shoes uncomfortable or unwearable.
