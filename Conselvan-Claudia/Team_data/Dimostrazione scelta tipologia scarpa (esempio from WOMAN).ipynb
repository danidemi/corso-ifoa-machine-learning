They arrived very quickly, and I was very impressed by the boot itself. These do not look like cheap boots! The material is soft, yet the cuff holds up quite nicely on the leg and doesn\\'t slide downward. The calf is plenty wide for me and I have larger legs, and they are a perfect shade of black. The fit is true to size, and they were completely comfortable straight out of the box. The soles have a nice tread on them and won\\'t keep you sliding across the floor.I wore them while shopping most of the afternoon, and then took a walk around the lake that evening with my boyfriend, and my feet never hurt...which is saying a lot from a woman who has to wear birkenstocks because her feet hurt in most shoes! I don\\'t think I\\'ll have to put an insole in these boots. OH..and I\\'ve already received compliments on them, and one lady in the store wanted to know where to buy them. You can\\'t go wrong with these boots!One tip would be to spray them with suede and leather waterproofing before going out in the rain.

This is my second pair of this style. My older pair is the shorter version which Ugg has sadly discontinued. I preferred the shorter version for the more flattering shaft height, but the benefit of the tall version is having sheepskin up higher on the leg for warmth. When wearing bootcut jeans these boots remind me of the look of an Ariat Fatbaby boot with a round toe. After a long search online and in stores, this is the only REAL SHEEPSKIN lined boot that has a taller shaft to keep legs warm AND great traction for snow. I was a bit concerned about ordering the taller style to wear under my bootcut jeans because I don\\'t like seeing the bump under the jeans from the top of the boot, but it works fine with a couple of pairs of my jeans. My other concern was no side zipper but the upper is soft and I\\'m able to push it down and easily remove my foot. My normal size in shoes is 6.5 for running shoes and sandals and a 7 for boots and I ordered a 7 in these and it fits. Same size as my shorter version of this style. For me, the foot portion was snug at first especially at the top of my foot but with wearing a few times the sheepskin and leather has molded to my foot well. I wear these barefoot to take advantage of the warmth and comfort of the sheepskin on my feet and legs. I could fit a thin sock but prefer without. The shaft is a more loose fit with a softer leather than the foot portion of the boot. I have an athletic muscular runners calf at 13 inches around and the shaft fits fine. Personally I won\\'t be wearing these over pants or with skirts because they height hits my leg at the large part of my calf and this makes my legs look \\\\\\\\\"big\\\\\\\\\" ..since you are supposed to have boots above or below the large part of your calf for a slim looking leg, this is not flattering height on me. (I am a thin athletic 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\"). But since I purchased these to wear under pants it\\'s no problem. This wouldn\\'t be an issue for a thin calf person.

I\\'m a sportswoman. I love to fish, hunt, ride, anything outdoors and these boots do it all well. You must wear them barefooted to appreciate them and get all the benefits of the shearling. The shearling will keep your foot warm in winter, cool in summer, and even moisturize it like lanolin. I wear a 7.5, have a super high instep, slender calves, and 8 is great. The round toe box has plenty of room especially if you wear them barefooted as recommended. All that fluffy shearling inside will feel different and a little tight at first but its very pliable and quickly molds to your foot for a perfect fit. In the pictures the outsoles look a little aggressive but the boot is better looking in person. The white stitching goes dark very quickly and it doesn\\'t draw your eye to the outsoles like it does in the pictures. I\\'ve had mine at least ten years and when I clean them up they look nearly new. For the punishment I\\'ve given them, the outsoles have held up remarkably! The insoles are replaceable and that\\'s great for refreshing the boot a couple times a year. I fly fish and late of a day when I\\'ve been on the water all day, these boots start calling my name. Oh what heaven to slip my cold, tired, aching, wet feet into my soft, comforting, warm UGGs for the ride home. There\\'s something very nice about being able to go barefooted in your boots.

I well abuse my footwear doing everything from walking in the barnyard to hiking steep, rocky trails and these boots keep me steady on my feet while protecting my lower legs from briars and snakes. The outsoles just keep going! After 10 years of hard use there\\'s not one crack in them and no separation from the uppers! Follow the UGG instructions to ditch your socks because barefooted is the only way you will truly appreciate shearling and just how cool it is in summer and warm it is in winter. I have to give credit to the sheep for inventing the best material on the planet for comfort in all kinds of weather and conditions. These boots are highly water resistant and have kept my feet nice and dry thru a lot of mud and muck and many creek crossings although I highly recommend giving them a loving rub down with a good leather care product like Sof Sole Mink Oil, 3.5-Ounce periodically. As far as style, while these are not dress boots, they are slightly on the chunky side but only slightly and not nearly as chunky or casual looking as the UGG Australia Women\\'s Classic Tall Boots or the UGG Australia Classic Short Boots, they look great with everything from camo and jeans to shorts and skirts.Read more\",\"title\":\"Best Shearling Boot Hands Down\",\"username\":\"Mary Allen\"},{\"date\":\"2013-03-30T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-01T03:29:41Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-12-09T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Womens-Brooks-Leather/dp/B0012NQ0GM\",\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Womens-Brooks-Leather/dp/B000VAPR34\"],\"text\":\"i normally wear size 6-6.5, depending on the type of shoe. i originally bought the 7 but was way too big. went down to the 6 and it was slightly snug at first but it does loosen up. extremely warm. though it doesn\\'t get too chilly here in SoCal, we do get cold snaps that bring it down in to the low 30\\'s. plus it\\'s great for when you want to go up in to the mountains where the snow is at!there is a real sole on these boots, so it\\'s nice to have traction. i can still tuck in my regular jeans inside the boots (just barely) or wear them over the boots. skinny jeans would def fit better tucked in.\",\"title\":\"fits well\",\"username\":\"g.nuggs\"},{\"date\":\"2013-02-22T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-01T03:29:41Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-11-27T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Womens-Brooks-Leather/dp/B000VAPR34\",\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Womens-Brooks-Leather/dp/B0012NQ0GM\"],\"text\":\"When I received my boots i put them on quick to try them, AMAZING, I love them when you feel comfort the moment you put something on is good, I wore them all week to work, they did crease up a little on the back which was a little bother cause it felt like if I had something poking me , not sharp thou, so I recommend on all your uggs to keep them from creasing to quick, when not wearing them put the cardboard pieces they came in back in them it keeps them straight in your closet plus it keeps it from creasing , I love all my uggs and so does my daughter we all share them being we the same size.

They are also very well made. I\\'m very pleased. :)\",\"title\":\"Follow The Manufacturer Sizing Instructions Carefully\",\"username\":\"P.

Those are very uncomfortable to walk in since they are so stiff and on the front where they kink as you walk, they often quickly crack and leak. Off to the store for a new pair or the shed to check if the last pair had a leaking left so I can use that right boot in place of my newer current failed one.

Simply put, they are great and I find myself wearing them more and having dryer feet as opposed to opting for shoes and then suffering with wet feet.

While spraying the shoes I noticed the made in China label and paused... I thought Ugg boots were made in Australia! Puzzled because the boots are nice and I bought through an awesome authorized seller ( thank you Snow River)! I decided to do some online research and boy did I learn a LOT! The best way to sum it up is:* I prefer the Ugg made in Australia since 1974* brand over Ugg Australia manufactured in China. I own both brands and the Australian ones are better and are holding up much better than the Chinese product. The wool also is much softer and looks better. I also purchased a pair from Mortels and they too are softer and hold up much better than UggAustraliaBut I thought UGGs made elsewhere were all Fakes!That is a lie. IF your boots were manufactured in AUSTRALIA is made up of Australian wool, shearling, sheepskin and EVA they ARE GENUINE UGG BOOTS! UGG is just a generic term for the style of shoe that is common in Australia. Australian Uggs are NOT associated with the brand UGG Australia ( the current UGGs you find here on Amazon).The Ugg boot warDecker Outdoor Company manufacture THE BRAND UGG Australia. Deckers is a USA Company and all of their boots are MASS PRODUCED IN CHINA! So look for the MADE IN AUSTRALIA symbol (a yellow kangaroo hopping in front of a green triangle which the Australian government approved ), IF you want genuine made in Australia, assembled in Australia using Australian wool UGGs. IF you want the Deckers USA Ugg Australia boots that everyone here is familiar with, buy them from an AUTHORIZED seller here on Amazon.

I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around. I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake. The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them. The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them. The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight. The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target. The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin. My mother took one look and said no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs. She is absouletly 100 correct. So, the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different, there is no sticker on the box, the outside and inside quality are very poor, they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly, and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer\\'s. I\\'m not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again. There is no comparing the items. I don\\'t like giving negative reviews because I\\'ve always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer\\'s but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store.\",\"title\":\"Don\\'t believe they are authentic\",\"username\":\"Jinksy\"},{\"dateAdded\":\"2016-01-13T03:42:26Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-11-28T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Classic-Chestnut-Sheepskin/dp/B002XFBE46\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Ugg-Australia-Classic-Short-size/dp/B0034AZBW0\",\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Toddler-Classic-Boot-BABY/dp/B003YAOABS\",\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Childrens-Classic-Little/dp/B002XON6YS\",\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Classic-Chestnut-Sheepskin/dp/B00PY5LVZY\",\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Classic-Chestnut-Sheepskin/dp/B00144PWM2\",\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Classic-Sheepskin-Chestnut/dp/B003OBXU1S\",\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Classic-Chestnut-Sheepskin/dp/B000E69Z3S\",\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Classic-Chocolate-Sheepskin/dp/B000LVJ6H6\",\"http://www.amazon.com/UGG-Australia-Classic-Chocolate-Sheepskin/dp/B001TJ4CFA\"],\"text\":\"I spent several days researching the right pair of boots. I narrowed it down to UGGs which had very positive reviews but were pricey, and EMUs which seemed to be basically the same product for half the price. Sounds too good to be true It is.Here is what I found:- UGGs are made of sheepskin inside and out, and cost 130-160 forthe most popular type (called Classic, short or tall), more for thefancier varieties (but I honestly prefer the look of the Classicmodel)- EMUs have TWO types of products: (1) sheepskin inside and out, and(2) cowhide outside, merino wool inside. The first variety cost thesame as the UGGs, the second one (not as cozy, not as comfi) costabout half the priceSo, I went with the UGGs which appear to be the more original/popular and am VERY VERY happy - these boots really insulate you from the harsh cold completely. Happy feet are worth the for me in thise case. I got the tall variety in grey, and LOVE LOVE LOVE them.Another misconception that I\\'d like to correct - NEITHER is 100 waterproof - as in they\\'ll basically keep you warm and dry in a reasonable amount of rain/snow, but if you drench them it will show (common sense). UGGs has real waterproof models which are more like regular snow boots etc. UGGs also has a water-resistant treatment to improve the durability, but friends I spoke to didn\\'t do that and haven\\'t had any water seeping in when she\\'s worn UGGs in the rain.So basically, the real deal sheepskin product costs the same (and is similar in quality, comfort).I had such a hard time figuring this out - shame on all the websites for sneakily pretending that the cheaper EMUs are made of the same material, which they are not!\",\"title\":\"Torn b/w UGGs and EMUs Read me!\",\"username\":\"P.

If you kind of fall between sizes, like I do (between a 7 and 7.5), I might suggest going with the larger size.My main reason for this review is to discuss the packaging, which concerned me at first. The shoes arrived in a plain white box within the Amazon box with a cut-out of the original Nike box next to the shoes. The shoes themselves weren\\'t stuffed with paper as new shoes always are. Concerned that these were not new as advertised or, worse, they were knockoffs, I contacted the seller. The owner of Plug Nickel Traders, Doug, responded within a few hours and explained that they receive the shoes on pallets, which sometimes results in the original brand boxes becoming damaged. So, to protect the shoes, they re-package them in sturdy white boxes with the original box cutout included to prove authenticity. He was very professional (even in response to my somewhat snarky email!) and that explanation makes sense to me. Apparently, repackaging is common when the original packaging becomes damaged while in shipment to the vendor and is allowable by Amazon.Having said all that, the proof is in the pudding. The quality and comfort of these shoes leave me no doubt these are brand new and authentic Nike.

Absolutely love the elasticized trim. In addition to keeping out dirt, stones, mulch and the usual detritus that used to work its way into my shoes, it greatly adds to the overall comfort.You can tell that a lot of thought went into these shoes. Even the tread pattern works well - it provides good grip in mud or on wet grass, but does not allow the mud and dirt to cake up like waffle tread shoes do. Yes, some mud will stick to the bottom after you slog through the muck but just let it dry, then bang the shoes together the next day and they are clean and ready to go.Very easy to slip on. With some practice, you can slip it on without using your hands - gives you the benefits of a shoe but the easy slip-on nature of a clog.Runs a bit large. I wear a mens size 11 that fits fine in a sneaker or regular shoe. The Muck Boot size 11 was a wee bit large - 10 would have probably been perfect, but they don\\'t sell half sizes. It does not distract from comfort, but if you normally wear a half size, you probably would want to order the next size down. On the other hand, the greater roominess allows me to wear heavy socks without any problem.If you garden, you gotta get these. I\\'d give up my Felco pruner or my Hori Hori knife before I would give up these!

Absolutely love the elasticized trim. In addition to keeping out dirt, stones, mulch and the usual detritus that used to work its way into my shoes, it greatly adds to the overall comfort.You can tell that a lot of thought went into these shoes. Even the tread pattern works well - it provides good grip in mud or on wet grass, but does not allow the mud and dirt to cake up like waffle tread shoes do. Yes, some mud will stick to the bottom after you slog through the muck but just let it dry, then bang the shoes together the next day and they are clean and ready to go.Very easy to slip on. With some practice, you can slip it on without using your hands - gives you the benefits of a shoe but the easy slip-on nature of a clog.Runs a bit large. I wear a mens size 11 that fits fine in a sneaker or regular shoe. The Muck Boot size 11 was a wee bit large - 10 would have probably been perfect, but they don\\'t sell half sizes. It does not distract from comfort, but if you normally wear a half size, you probably would want to order the next size down. On the other hand, the greater roominess allows me to wear heavy socks without any problem.If you garden, you gotta get these. I\\'d give up my Felco pruner or my Hori Hori knife before I would give up these! (Well, maybe not, but it would be a thinker as to which is more valuable.)\",\"title\":\"Nirvana in a rubber shoe 87 of 91 people found this helpful.

The Rider 16 had shed some weight but I felt it rode higher than other brands I\\'d started wearing. Additionally, there was a stiffness to the ride that became more apparent on long runs, and I found the cushioning lacking in the metatarsal area.

They may feel flatter to some because of the lack of midfoot hug, and Mizuno is using a new material which is lighter weight than the old midsole compound.

They are quite a bit more nimble and more flexible. My suggestion for the 18 would be for Mizuno to lower the heel even further and provide greater cush in the forefoot area.

I have owned and out-mileaged 4 pair of Wave Riders including the 14, 15 and am now my third pair of 16\\'s. There are so many new features in the 17 it feels like a totally different shoe. Some reviewers I read noted it being a soft shoe, I found the opposite actually, and where the previous models felt like they were hugging my foot and cushioned all around, I felt as if the shoe was flat and the only cushion was limited and directly under my foot. I didn\\'t feel the stability of the 16 (though it is a neutral stability - I feel my foot is supported well in the previous models). In the 17 my foot actually felt lost in the shoe and gave more of the feeling of running on a hard, flat surface - no bounce, no spring and no support. There is less cloth on the upper and the shoe just didn\\'t feel stable on my foot. There is less padding around the ankle - which many say is an improvement, I am neutral on that point.Finally, there is a very visible change in the curvature of the shoe. Previous models of the Wave Rider had a noted rise in the toe of the shoe. With the new model, the entire sole of the shoe is flat. This is a significant change in the Wave Rider model.Overall, I had high hopes for the Wave Rider 17, but am very disheartened. The moment I placed the shoe on my foot I felt the significant change, running in them confirmed it. The comfort, stability (albeit minimal) and roll of the shoe is gone. It is a totally different shoe, quite comparable to the Sayonara which I have also run in. I really have nothing good to say about the 17, except that its release has lowered the price of the previous model, which I will be stocking up on - no intention to purchase this new model.\",\"title\":\"Total Makeover - No Similarities to 16\",\"username\":\"Laurel E.

I went to a great running store (Brooklyn Running Co. in NYC) where the guy spent a ton of time fitting me, and ended up with these puppies.Yes, the Mizuno Wave Rider 17 is apparently very different from the old versions. But most of the bad reviews seem to be coming from previous Wave Rider owners! If you are coming into this new shoe/brand looking for something with enough support for longer distances that won\\'t drag you down when you get to the last few miles, these shoes are great. I successfully ran that first half-marathon yesterday in them, with a time I don\\'t think I could have gotten wearing heavier shoes.The only thing I think could be better is that the fore-foot could use the slightest bit more cushioning. Literally, even just a half a centimeter, or a couple millimeters! I tend to land more mid-foot, and it\\'d be nice to have that fore-foot support for push-off. But honestly, after running 13.1 miles, I hardly even noticed it. I sure am sore from the distance, but my feet feel great -- no blisters or black toes here!Anyway, I never write reviews, but I thought I would write this one in case anyone else (like myself) got nervous reading the crazy amount of negative reviews. It seems to me this just isn\\'t the shoe for past-Wave Rider users. But it could be the shoe for a whole new fan base.If you can, try these on in a running store before ordering online. It really is the best way to see if a running shoe is right for you.(Also posted on Mizuno\\'s webpage for this shoe.)\",\"title\":\"Great supportive, yet lightweight, shoe 1 of 1 people found this helpful.

I have owned and out-mileaged 4 pair of Wave Riders including the 14, 15 and am now my third pair of 16\\'s. There are so many new features in the 17 it feels like a totally different shoe. Some reviewers I read noted it being a soft shoe, I found the opposite actually, and where the previous models felt like they were hugging my foot and cushioned all around, I felt as if the shoe was flat and the only cushion was limited and directly under my foot. I didn\\'t feel the stability of the 16 (though it is a neutral stability - I feel my foot is supported well in the previous models). In the 17 my foot actually felt lost in the shoe and gave more of the feeling of running on a hard, flat surface - no bounce, no spring and no support. There is less cloth on the upper and the shoe just didn\\'t feel stable on my foot. There is less padding around the ankle - which many say is an improvement, I am neutral on that point.Finally, there is a very visible change in the curvature of the shoe. Previous models of the Wave Rider had a noted rise in the toe of the shoe. With the new model, the entire sole of the shoe is flat. This is a significant change in the Wave Rider model.Overall, I had high hopes for the Wave Rider 17, but am very disheartened. The moment I placed the shoe on my foot I felt the significant change, running in them confirmed it. The comfort, stability (albeit minimal) and roll of the shoe is gone. It is a totally different shoe, quite comparable to the Sayonara which I have also run in. I really have nothing good to say about the 17, except that its release has lowered the price of the previous model, which I will be stocking up on - no intention to purchase this new model.\",\"title\":\"Total Makeover - No Similarities to 16 67 of 70 people found this helpful.

The construction of the shoe is superior, although the look of a more fully enclosed shoe is a little clunkier looking than the Maryjane styles. They are rather heavy, but it doesn\\'t affect the comfort or the ability to wear them all day without foot pain. The padding at the top of the heel is a great touch. Since it is a full shoe, the fit of the Velcro strap is important - I have narrow feet, so cannot wear any of the slip-on styles, and one of the older oxford (tie) styles couldn\\'t tie tight enough to fit,so I may need to take these to a shoe repair shop and have the Velcro adjusted so they can be cinched tighter.Overall they are a wonderfully comfortable shoe, can wear them from morning til bedtime without pain.

This is an inset slipper (like a tennis shoe style, not an open back like a house slipper)2. The material is plush and thick! Walking on these is like a padded carpet under your feet at all times.3. They are colorful and vibrant and well made. Not loose threads, eyes are stitched on well and yes, the hanging eyeballs actually flop around when you walk!Con: Packing. I\\'d give this a 5, but they literally showed up shoved in a small plastic mailing container with no protective bag or sealed packaging. I had to squish them down just to get them out.

They were a complete hit with everyone. Really, who wouldn\\'t want that vision of decomposing zombies eating their feet These aren\\'t your basic old boring slippers.The only small issue I had with them was with the fit. While their one size fits most is large enough for all but the largest of feet, they\\'re really pretty wide and not necessarily tapered to a foot shape. Still, the sole is VERY padded so they are pretty comfortable. Because they ARE so cushy, I think they\\'d fit snugly enough for all but the smallest of women\\'s feet (they fit me and I wear a womens 8.5) and all but the very largest of men\\'s feet (they fit my husband who wears size 11). I\\'d say that any foot much larger than that might be a bit too long.The colors and details are just what you\\'d expect from undead footwear. The skin tone is a greying-greenish decayed flesh color (and nice and fuzzy!) and those lovely dangling eyeballs really make the whole look of the slipper work. One added bonus that you can\\'t really see in the posted Amazon pic is the brain slice protruding right above the hair line.They are definitely beauties.\",\"title\":\"Who wouldn\\'t want decomposing zombies on their feet\",\"username\":\"Catrinka\"},{\"date\":\"2012-09-20T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-01T02:06:59Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-12-14T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Think-Geek-Zombie-Plush-Slippers/dp/B0080HZH5I\"],\"text\":\"Great product, fast.shipping, great price, was exactly.as seen in pics and described.

I have found through shoe experimentation that I really really love lightweight runners, but I pronate (my normal to high arch rolls in and almost flat when I step) so I need good support through the mid section of my foot that isn\\'t too rigid. If you have done much running shoe research, lightweight and support don\\'t usually fall into the same category but THESE FIT ALL MY REQUIREMENTS - lightweight at just over 6oz, snug but the woven material gives just enough to stay comfortable and move with your foot instead of being rigid, they are narrow but I have normal width feet and prefer the narrowness - if you have wide feet or prefer the wide toe box shoes, these are not the shoe for you! I usually buy 9\\'s in my Brooks but the 9\\'s were a bit to short for me in these - I exchanged them for the 9 1/2 and they are perfect. The feel great too, just enough cushion to be feel comfortable but so much that I feel like I\\'m sinking or so that I can\\'t feel the ground.

Many reviews report these shoes running too small, but climbing shoes are SUPPOSED to fit very snugly like a sock. Your toes should be curled and take up all the space up front. The first time trying them on SHOULD be uncomfortable (maybe a tad bit painful), as long as there is not too much pressure/pain on the heel (or else one risks tearing their Achilles). This is because these shoes are made with REAL LEATHER, so they will stretch out immensely over time. To expedite the stretching, I soaked them in water with a hose then wore them around while they dried - the next day, they fit perfectly!The reason why I gave these shoes 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the following reasons:1) The laces do not go all the way to the toe. As a climber with very small/narrow toes, this leaves me with more toe space than desirable (where the white dots are on the outer edge).2) The rubber is grippy, but not so much as I would like it.

Many reviews report these shoes running too small, but climbing shoes are SUPPOSED to fit very snugly like a sock. Your toes should be curled and take up all the space up front. The first time trying them on SHOULD be uncomfortable (maybe a tad bit painful), as long as there is not too much pressure/pain on the heel (or else one risks tearing their Achilles). This is because these shoes are made with REAL LEATHER, so they will stretch out immensely over time. To expedite the stretching, I soaked them in water with a hose then wore them around while they dried - the next day, they fit perfectly!The reason why I gave these shoes 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the following reasons:1) The laces do not go all the way to the toe. As a climber with very small/narrow toes, this leaves me with more toe space than desirable (where the white dots are on the outer edge).2) The rubber is grippy, but not so much as I would like it. But you get what you paid for.I climb indoor in these shoes 3-4 times a week for 2-4 hours, and they have been very sturdy and allowed me to gain excellent footing so far!\",\"title\":\"Great quality! 15 of 15 people found this helpful.

I run all the time on the treadmill and outdoors. I have done quite a bit of research because the nike 2.0 is popular among my friends, however they do more weight lifting. The Nike Free 5.0 is definitely more light weight and flexible than the 2.0. It also offers a lot more arch support for those of us who have really high arches! Another great thing is that the toe area is wider than most running shoes. (They may look like duck feet from the wearers point of view, but trust me it\\'s for a good reason!) When someone is running, the moment their foot connects with the ground on each step, all of the tiny bones in the foot need to be able to spread out, because the toe on this shoe is so wide it allows for that to happen. If the foot is constricted in a narrow shoe, the bones are going to grind together because they are not allowed the room they need, this can cause a lot of foot pain and more severe problems down the line. The Nike 2.0 is not as wide as the 5.0 and any training shoe isn\\'t going to have this feature. If you are looking for great running shoe, or just a comfortable shoe that you can wear all day, this is definitely a great buy and well worth the money! I now have 2 pairs of these shoes and wear them for working 8 hour shifts where I am walking/standing all day, and to the gym to run a couple of miles! Also this shoe fits true to size. If you\\'re not sure of what size you should get, I would suggest getting half a size up! I wear 5.5 in sandals, and 6 in flats or heels, but in running shoes I always get a 6.5! That way they are never too snug and I can wear them with thin or thick socks!\",\"title\":\"absolute favorite shoe for running!\",\"username\":\"Sarah Campbell\"},{\"date\":\"2013-11-29T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-11-11T04:35:04Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-11-10T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Free-Running-Womens-Shoes/dp/B00E6ET2A0\"],\"text\":\"I would highly recommend this product to those looking for comfort....support...great style combined with fabulous color choices.I love this shoe!!!\",\"title\":\"Great Design ...fabulous color\",\"username\":\"Julie Taube\"},{\"dateAdded\":\"2015-11-11T04:35:04Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-11-10T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Free-Running-Womens-Shoes/dp/B00E6ET2A0\"],\"text\":\"I love these shoes!

I live in Seattle, WA so it didn\\'t take long to do so.Size: I\\'m a size five and they fit perfectly. The back heel/ankle support doesn\\'t cut into my ankle and helps keep the boot on. The knit has an inner lining that helps them not stretch out much but, isn\\'t too tight to be uncomfortable.Color: True to the image provided. I received mine in Linen and it\\'s a very tasteful off-white/cream. Very light in color.Weather: Here\\'s the kicker. So I did dodge puddles on my walk, to the best of my ability (if you know Seattle this is nearly impossible), and these boots kept my feet DRY and WARM. I was shocked! I don\\'t see them holding up in a puddle jumping contest or hiking through a foot of snow but, I was pleasantly surprised they held up during the wind and consistent rain. The sole is thick and that helped a lot. It seemed like the knit was somewhat water repellant Not too sure but, they weren\\'t damp and neither were my socks after.Comfort: If you\\'re not used to UGGS or Bearpaw style boots it can take a little getting used to. As a seasoned pro, they\\'re very comfortable. I walk everywhere I go or use the metro, so I tend to wear out shoes quick. They\\'re holding up so far and I have a feeling they will hold up for a long time. I will have to edit this review after a few months of wear to see if they stretch out.Note: I prefer Bearpaw over UGGS. They\\'re cheaper and a ton more durable. I\\'ve owned the Boetis style boot the longest (one year for sure) and the sole finally has a leak (when walking in the rain) due to a previous horrid encounter with broken glass. No damage to me thanks to the boots but now they have a slice through the sole. The other unscathed boot is still holding strong.\",\"title\":\"Big Bearpaw Fan\",\"username\":\"Maddie\"},{\"date\":\"2009-12-16T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-01T02:51:08Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-12-09T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/BEARPAW-Womens-Knit-Tall-Black/dp/B001O02CZG\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Bearpaw-Knit-Triangle-Button-Boots/dp/B00EKHMETY\",\"http://www.amazon.com/BEARPAW-Womens-Knit-Tall-Winter/dp/B001O02D0K\"],\"text\":\"Great boots. Buy these, not the Ugg sweater cardy\\'sFor comparison: I own 2 pairs of UGG boots, the Costco copycats, and now these. The quality of these meets and/or exceeds that of the original UGG boots. As the reviewer above stated, the soles are solid. There is not a lot of structure to this boot style- there is the sole and the back ankle suede to give it some shape, but other than that- it is very much like a sock attached to a sole. I think this boot is great for around the house and casual wear.Sizing: They definitely run small. I am a 6.5/7 shoe and the size 7 has my toe rubbing tip of the boot. If Amazon allowed for reinstatement of promo offers, I would have sized up. Since they do not, I will hope that the fur lining settles down like other shearling boots. I have skinny calves and often have a hard time finding boots with a calf circumference small enough- while these are still loose, they stay up enough to achieve the slouchy look.Comfort: soft footbed. Has as much padding as standard UGG boots (that is to say- not much beyond the fur). No arch support. Initially the suede ankle cup on one of them curved in and cut into my ankle, but after taming the sharp edge with a nail-file it has stopped doing that. For keeping warm- probably not in the wind, there is not much in the way of lining- I do not consider this to be an all-weather boot by any means.*update* 1 month later. Boots have stretched and now feel loose. After 2 days of wear, 1 set of buttons at the top fell off. Still comfortable, but long lasting quality on this style is definitely questionable. I have dropped the rating from 4 stars to 2. It is unacceptable that the knit of the boot stretches so much that it flops around and does not fit anymore.\",\"title\":\"Run small, comfy *Updated*\",\"username\":\"Professional Student\"},{\"date\":\"2010-03-19T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-01T02:51:08Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-12-09T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/BEARPAW-Womens-Knit-Tall-Black/dp/B001O02CZG\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Bearpaw-Knit-Triangle-Button-Boots/dp/B00EKHMETY\",\"http://www.amazon.com/BEARPAW-Womens-Knit-Tall-Winter/dp/B001O02D0K\"],\"text\":\"I love this boot!

When I first wore them out I was expecting to have to break them in and have sore feet for a good week, but was pleasantly surprised in this area too. In general I find Sketchers shoes I\\'ve purchased have been excellent to wear from day one, but wasn\\'t certain if this trait would carry over to the high boot department -- but it did!I get compliments on them all the time and questions on where I got them. They\\'re incredibly comfortable and warm in the 30 degree weather right now in Georgia, US. They also fit nicely under my boot-cut jeans, but also great over my skinny pants.

They are literally weightless. The sole has the comfort of a sneaker. The top is stretchy but doesn\\'t get tighter and tighter all day as some elastic shoes do. Traction is great. They are stylish! I\\'d say they sit right on the border between casual and casual/dressy. They could definitely be worn in a summer work environment. I find that the black soles look dressier than the gray ones. I can wear them all day and never even feel them on my feet.After reading all the comments about sizing variations, I decided, what the heck I\\'ll just order my regular size and hope for the best. I ordered three pair in my regular size. One pair is a little big, one\\'s a little small and one is jusssst right. Actually I kinda prefer the snug pair, they are not binding or painful and feel quite secure on my feet. If you have issues with foot swelling you would want the larger ones. The larger pair has a loose strap which I may take to a shoe shop to take in. The design of the shoe is quite flattering to the foot and does not look in any way clunky. That said, they are all wearable and I am thrilled with this purchase! Can\\'t wait to get them in more colors....The three colors I got are the silver/gray, bronze, and the bronze multi.The silver gray is beautiful and sparkles like crazy in the sun, less sparkle indoors. The bronze with black soles are gorgeous! The shoe appears like wicker or woven grass indoors and sparkles in the sun. Their black sole makes them appear a little dressier to me. The bronze/ multi is done in somewhat Southwest colors, with the sparkly bronze background and are quite fun.

I bought a pair of the Premium clogs and now I am ruined for the other ones.The original Sloggers clogs have always been my standard shoe all spring, summer and fall for working in the yard, painting, or doing anything that might get messy or wet. They have plenty of support so that you can climb ladders without killing your arches. The closed PVC toe keeps you from breaking your tootsies if you drop a hammer or something heavy or pointed on them and the bottoms are just thick enough that if you stepped on something sharp and undesirable, you won\\'t impale your foot. (So, I use them for house repairs, mowing, painting, gardening, and decorating as well). The best part if that they can be hosed off, so if you step in dog poo at the dog park, or drop paint or step in mud, no problem. They can be scrubbed and don\\'t have straps to break or stretch. Your sweat makes the original Sloggers vacuum seal onto your feet, so I never wear them with socks.Besides just being pretty, these Premium clogs have a cushion in the bottom that feels great, is removable and washable. It makes them much more comfortable to run around to stores, which is great for wandering all over Home Depot to find that object you forgot to get to finish whatever project you are working on). You can go straight from the yard to the store and back and not have to change shoes. And even wearing them bear, the bottoms of your feet won\\'t turn into callous-mats like flip flops will.Premium Sloggers are head and shoulders better than flip flops or summer sandals for daily wear.

I usually wear a size 7.5 shoe, wear a 37 medium in Birkenstocks and the size 8 Sloggers are very fine for me. I likely could also fit into a 7, but because I\\'d like to wear socks if I desire, I followed the recommendations of others and moved up a size rather than down. Another consideration I had when ordering was that when I work, particularly in the summertime, my feet swell, so I sized up. An advantage of these clogs over many others is that their insoles make for a softer, more cushioned feel and they are removable for cleaning or airing out. I find that wearing these requires no socks in the garden, a huge pro for me since my socks become filthy when I wear Crocs clogs. The Sloggers put the Crocs to shame even though they are heavier. I much prefer the feel and appearance of their real sole rather than a self molded one piece shoe. The black sole is a nice contrast, as is the black interior and the bottom of the sole has a lovely swoosh type design in the Kiwi color. Walking in dirt or mud is not an issue because these shoes can be hosed off. The design of the clogs has a rear which is a bit elevated, so your heel is a little more protected than in other clogs. I\\'ve worn Birkenstock shoes for many, many years and now that I\\'ve discovered Sloggers, I have an alternate manufacturer to choose from, and these are made in the USA!

An advantage of these clogs over many others is that their insoles make for a softer, more cushioned feel and they are removable for cleaning or airing out. I find that wearing these requires no socks in the garden, a huge pro for me since my socks become filthy when I wear Crocs clogs. The Sloggers put the Crocs to shame even though they are heavier. I much prefer the feel and appearance of their real sole rather than a self molded one piece shoe. The black sole is a nice contrast, as is the black interior and the bottom of the sole has a lovely swoosh type design in the Kiwi color. Walking in dirt or mud is not an issue because these shoes can be hosed off. The design of the clogs has a rear which is a bit elevated, so your heel is a little more protected than in other clogs. I\\'ve worn Birkenstock shoes for many, many years and now that I\\'ve discovered Sloggers, I have an alternate manufacturer to choose from, and these are made in the USA! These are great gardening shoes which are nice enough to wear all day inside or out.\",\"title\":\"Kiwi is a lovely color, shoes are so comfortable\",\"username\":\"zhabazon\"},{\"date\":\"2011-02-05T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-02T00:15:15Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Sloggers-Womens-Premium-Garden-Insole/dp/B000GXSHAG\"],\"text\":\"Some years ago I was shopping in a garden store and came across a rack of shoes called Sloggers and were advertised as great garden shoes.

I bought a pair of the Premium clogs and now I am ruined for the other ones.The original Sloggers clogs have always been my standard shoe all spring, summer and fall for working in the yard, painting, or doing anything that might get messy or wet. They have plenty of support so that you can climb ladders without killing your arches. The closed PVC toe keeps you from breaking your tootsies if you drop a hammer or something heavy or pointed on them and the bottoms are just thick enough that if you stepped on something sharp and undesirable, you won\\'t impale your foot. (So, I use them for house repairs, mowing, painting, gardening, and decorating as well). The best part if that they can be hosed off, so if you step in dog poo at the dog park, or drop paint or step in mud, no problem. They can be scrubbed and don\\'t have straps to break or stretch. Your sweat makes the original Sloggers vacuum seal onto your feet, so I never wear them with socks.Besides just being pretty, these Premium clogs have a cushion in the bottom that feels great, is removable and washable. It makes them much more comfortable to run around to stores, which is great for wandering all over Home Depot to find that object you forgot to get to finish whatever project you are working on). You can go straight from the yard to the store and back and not have to change shoes. And even wearing them bear, the bottoms of your feet won\\'t turn into callous-mats like flip flops will.Premium Sloggers are head and shoulders better than flip flops or summer sandals for daily wear. Keep your sandals for dates and wear these Sloggers for everything else.\",\"title\":\"very comfy - wish they came in every color 120 of 122 people found this helpful.

I have large calves and have a really hard time finding taller boots that look nice and fit, especially with a heel. These fit better than expected. I ordered the size I normally wear and they are actually large enough that I can wear thick socks with them and still be comfortable. No squished toes!! For a 3 heel they are also super comfortable, more so than some of my flat boots. I would recommend adding arch support, but that is just me. They also have a nice rubber sole which makes them less slip prone. The best part about them is that they have a panel behind the laces so you don\\'t have skin visible if you need to expand the laces, as I do for my 18 calves. I have ordered other lace-up boots but always have to wear tights similar in color so you do not see a large expanse of skin behind the laces. This panel was a wonderful surprise. I will say that the laces are the same material as the boot and therefore difficult to tighten by yourself once the boot is on (I have to loosen the laces somewhat to zip the boot then tighten when on). I do think I will try replacing the laces with some durable ribbon that will be easier to tighten by myself. Possibly even change out the color of the ribbon depending on my outfit. Overall I am very happy with these boots.\",\"title\":\"Great Boots!\",\"username\":\"Kindle Customer\"}]',\n",

Unfortunately, with these slippers, I am now dreading putting them on each evening. They were somewhat comfortable at first, but after two weeks of wear, the cushiony insole is all squished down, and not providing much cushion any more. But the worst thing about these slippers is the hard rubber sole which makes them extremely noisy when I walk on my hardwood and tile floors! I usually get to bed at least an hour after my husband, and he has actually asked me to PLEASE go out and buy new slippers because I wake him up each time I walk through our bedroom!! Yes, I suppose you can wear them outside, but I have had other indoor/outdoor slippers which aren\\'t as hard bottomed, and therefore don\\'t sound like I\\'m walking around in tap shoes!!

I normally wear a 6 1/2 extra wide shoe. I purchased a 7 M shoe. The shoelaces are held together by a two-holed toggle that allows you to draw them up snug without any bow-ties. Then simply tuck the extra shoe lace ends under the laced portion at the shoe tongue, and there is a secure fit. So far, I have worn the shoes for my hi-intensity water aerobics class. I love the fact that each shoe has built in drainage holes in its sole.

I have these shoes almost for three years and use them for running as well as for indoorsport like gymnastics and aerobics! But I am not really very satisfied with the quality. Maybe it is caused by my outdoor adventures running trough rain and dirt. I do not really know if they are supposed to get very wet, So if you do not go out during bed weather you will probably not have any problems, but I did and that caused some scarcities, like the sole was not glueing on every places of the material.

I don\\'t ordinarily order shoes online, but my local shoe store doesn\\'t carry these shoes, so I decided to try them by ordering them. I will say that I liked the heel height for my dress pants, the leather was soft, and the shoe looked nice. However, even though the length was good, the shoe was rather wide. The top of the shoe stuck up well above my foot, and the back slipped up and down. For someone who has a wider foot, this might be a good thing. I had to return them--there was no way that I could wear these shoes for any length of time. Even though they were not going to fall off my foot, I could foresee some sore spots or even blisters on my feet by the end of the day, and they drove me crazy bobbing up and down on my heel when I tried them on here at home. I will say that the sole had some cushioning and that the memory foam insole was soft, but I don\\'t think the shoe would have provided the level of comfort that my Go Walk casual shoes have provided the insole was not as thick or cushy as I expected. I did wonder if these Flexibles would be as comfortable after several hours as my Go Walk shoes are. I hope this description will help others who might wonder how the shoes compare.\",\"title\":\"Sadly, too wide\",\"username\":\"Liz Baker\"}]',\n",

I was planning a short hike on the Appalachian Trail last year during a week that included a few possible days of rain, so i was looking for a shoe that wouldn\\'t soak and had some traction. After reading Amazon reviews on all women\\'s hiking boots I decided that Ahnu was the most promising brand. So I bought the Sugarpine in Honey!I was in love with them as soon as they arrived! The color contrast is stunning and the shoe fit exactly as expected. Very comfortable and roomy, but still seemed to give support. On the trail they were fabulous. Very lightweight and molded to the foot, but also sturdy enough so that I wasn\\'t feeling the pain of every rock. When most shoes claim to be waterproof I usually assume that to mean that they protect against light rain and splashed form puddles. These shoes are WATERPROOF.

I was planning a short hike on the Appalachian Trail last year during a week that included a few possible days of rain, so i was looking for a shoe that wouldn\\'t soak and had some traction. After reading Amazon reviews on all women\\'s hiking boots I decided that Ahnu was the most promising brand. So I bought the Sugarpine in Honey!I was in love with them as soon as they arrived! The color contrast is stunning and the shoe fit exactly as expected. Very comfortable and roomy, but still seemed to give support. On the trail they were fabulous. Very lightweight and molded to the foot, but also sturdy enough so that I wasn\\'t feeling the pain of every rock.

If at all possible, I suggest you go to a local shop, as I did, and get fitted the first time. AND PURCHASE THEM AT THE SHOP. They should only be about 20, so you won\\'t spend much more than online after shipping is factored in, and it would be really rude to waste their time that way. Not to mention that if internet shoppers put the local shops out of business, there won\\'t be anywhere to go when you need to get fitted! If that isn\\'t possible, here\\'s my experience for a reference point: I wear a 10.5 (which means I have to buy 10 in sandals and 11 in dress shoes, usually) and ended up wearing a 13W in Sansha slippers. The wide is just barely loose on my heel (elastic straps take care of that) but I have a fairly wide forefoot and wanted room in the front for my toes to really spread out for balance. These shrink ever so slightly, so if you are in between sizes go up as long as the larger size isn\\'t floppy.\",\"title\":\"Super comfy once broken in 54 of 59 people found this helpful.

I tried getting in touch with Hunter, however I was told that the boots are not covered by the warranty, because the boots are foldable. I was essentially told that because the material is thin and the boot is foldable, the boot is more susceptible to tearing and it is unlikely that the boots will not be replaced. I have only worn these boots a handful of times (since its summer in Chicago) and found that these boots are not durable. They scuff easily, making the boots more likely to tear at the seams. I am overall very disappointed in the product, but more so in Hunter\\'s inability to accommodate their customers needs. After deciding to spend 150 on these boots, I was at least hoping they would last me a year, and yet here I am.I was offered 20 off my next purchase but why should I invest my money into a pair of boots that will not last me more than a couple months.

Next time I will order a regular size 7 without the wider style and perhaps I will have a perfect fit I do love Gravity Defyer because of the bounciness and no more foot pain upon waking after a hard work out. They do take out the impact from jumping and walking. My knees are thankful as is my lower back. This is my third pair and I do highly recommend them. Other brands are plastic, narrow and say they have \\'air\\' but I believe its a gimmick. Ive had my share of sneakers and I love these. Saw them in an AARP magazine, thought they were for old folks (I\\'m 50 something) and now I see them everywhere. I got 2 pairs for the price of one Nike for 200 and more pleased, no rubbing, blisters, foot pain and I enjoy working out to my fullest. Where have you been all these years I know I could have exchanged them without any hassle, ( try and do that at Champs!) but hey, a little extra width is ok for those days I may swell with heat, winter with good thick socks etc so I look forward to buying more each and every year.

I have been climbing for about 6 months now. I can say I honestly love these shoes. I recently climbed in several other types of shoes during a shoe demo and that\\'s when I realized how great these are. I\\'m no shoe expert but the rubber on these seems awesome. I feel very confident on even the tiniest of foot holds. The velcro makes them easy to put on and take off and it can be adjusted to be nice and snug just about as well as lacing. They are SO comfortable (for climbing shoes). I climbed in these today for 5 hours without taking them off for a break from them. On top of all of that I get tons of compliments on them because they look really cool with the colors and design. Flashy :) I think these are a great choice for beginners and anyone looking for a comfortable training shoe.\",\"title\":\"I can say I honestly love these shoes 13 of 14 people found this helpful.

I have worn a size 8 since 9th grade and have been able to wear an 8 across the board with every brand of shoes I have ever bought. These I should have gotten an 8 1/2.2) There is no lining inside the boot so you pretty much have to wear socks or something otherwise the vinyl will rub against your leg and may or may not be irritating.3) With the boots being stretchy rubber, if your calves rub together they make a terribly irritating noise.4) The calf part of the boot is very small, which I am quite happy about since I have no leg muscle at all. But if you have large calves, these will probably NOT work for you.5) There is a seam that runs down the center of your foot and over the toe. Now this is not necessarily a bad thing, but I bought these as a cheap replacement pair of boots to wear to work... the seam along with the generally rubber appearance makes them not quite as classy as I would like for a work environment.Now if you are buying to go with a costume or to wear out dancing now and again then these should be perfectly fine, just order a half size larger than you would normally buy. If you are looking for a pair of every day boots, to go with jeans then these are fine and will probably make it through a school year.

One word of caution: Measure your foot and according to the VIBRAM website, look at the model you want to buy versus what size they recommend.

I love Naot brand shoes the Matai is a sure winner and I have purchased more than one pair in that style. I decided to go to my local store that sells Naot and try on other styles. I tried the Rongo (that I am reviewing here) and was immediately in love. These fit so well and were so comfortable that I went back to the store a week later and bought another pair. I have since ordered 2 more pairs.I wear a US size 9 regularly and the size 40 in Naot fits me in every style I\\'ve tried on, so I am unclear why other reviewers who wear a 9 found the Rongo to fit poorly. Must be the shape of their foot because I could wear the Rongo with no breaking-in period I can wear them all day, with or without hose/footies. The Rongo style is part of the same collection as the Matai, the Koru collection, so it\\'s obvious that this style fits me well. They are comfortable, offer excellent support, and the benefits of no aching feet, ankles, knees, hips, or back really make Naot shoes worth the extra money. In the past, I have purchased plenty of cheaper shoes from discount stores and large retail chains - most of them cause my feet to ache after a couple of hours. Not so with Naot they are my go-to shoe for traveling, working, running errands...every day.The fishnet/black color in the Rongo is ultra cute and chic I get multiple compliments on these shoes EVERY time I wear them. The toe box is particularly attractive with its unusual design, and the contrast of materials really makes a fun fashion statement. Same is true for the quartz and the metal leather colors the colors and unique pattern are so fun!

I have read several reviews that the elastic that holds the strap on the back of the shoes wears out faster than the shoes, but I have no personal experience with that since I didn\\'t keep them.

First of all, the color is not white at all, it\\'s more like mushroom/pale pale gold. They are very pretty in person. There is a bit of a problem with the sizing though. I usually wear a 10 in any type of shoe and they are a bit big on me. However, when I ordered the 41 (10) in brass they were very tight. I exchanged for a pair of 42 (11) in the quartz and they still fit a bit tight across the toes. I sadly returned those, they are too expensive to not fit perfectly. I then saw another pair in quartz on sale for 98 on Amazon so I decided to try again because I really loved the look of the shoe and could tell it would be comfortable if it fit, I have seen many reviews of this shoe saying there was a sizing problem.. This pair of size 42\\'s fit perfectly. They definitely run small, I never buy a size 42. I think it\\'s just sheer luck these are a bit bigger than the other pair.

And, I\\'ve never had a shoe make my pointed foot look so attractive!The bad: I got this in my normal Bloch ballet slipper size of 3.5 C (in Prolite and Proflex styles), and it feels a little tight, especially on my larger foot. I would probably try a size larger next time (though I\\'d be a little worried that I might be trading toe space for bagginess or looseness.) It would be GREAT if they had a D or E width. The pale salmon color is really odd on my dark olive skin color. I can\\'t imagine that it would look good on anyone.

I\\'ve always sized down 2-3 sizes for ballet shoes but these are painful.

The heels come pretty low on these Synchrony, I wish they\\'d come up higher I feel like they\\'re going to fall off.Between the two I think the Synchrony are more durable and give a bit more support on piques and pirouettes. So I actually prefer the Elastosplits for turns since then I feel like I\\'m strengthening my feet more.

Perhaps it was just luck for me, but the elastics all ended up in the right placement and tightness for me, so it saved me some sewing time. And, I\\'ve never had a shoe make my pointed foot look so attractive!The bad: I got this in my normal Bloch ballet slipper size of 3.5 C (in Prolite and Proflex styles), and it feels a little tight, especially on my larger foot. I would probably try a size larger next time (though I\\'d be a little worried that I might be trading toe space for bagginess or looseness.) It would be GREAT if they had a D or E width. The pale salmon color is really odd on my dark olive skin color. I can\\'t imagine that it would look good on anyone. If they had a suntan color (a perfect match for my skin), and in a D width, I would be very happy.The ugly: The quality seems to be horrible!

So I compared the new pair with the pair I already had, and the sole of the Keds I just got was 3/8 narrower than the old pair, and it was 1/4 shorter. Officially the same size, 7M in reality, at least a half size smaller.I sent them back for a refund. I still may buy a pair in 7.5M if I can get them really, really marked down. But I\\'m not sure if the current price, even Amazon\\'s, is worth what you get with the new design.\",\"title\":\"They\\'ve changed the sizing 98 of 105 people found this helpful.

I am a size 9 and the 9 fit perfectly lengthwise, but remember they run wide.

I am a sixty-two year old woman who walks 5-7 miles daily, sometimes a little more and occasionally a little less (if my feet are aching). I tend to get a few more aches and pains than when I was younger and sometimes I get aches and pains in my feet, probably because I walk so much. I have had a few broken bones in my feet and wrists, but no really severe broken bones, so I am not sure if that is a contributing factor, or just that I am getting older and walk so much. Some mornings I do wake up with stiffness in my hands, so I may have some minor arthritis due to having had broken bones in the past. I had been wearing the Merrell Moab shoes, which worked well for a while, though they were heavy. Then, I got a knot on the bottom of my foot in the arch area and also a pain on the top of my foot down the left side. I decided to go back to a lighter pair of shoes. In the past I had worn some very lightweight Merrell running shoes which were very comfortable, but I did tend to get a callous area on the outer edge of one of my feet on the side where my little toe is. I went to Dick\\'s and saw the Nike Flyknit 4.0 shoes and tried them on and instantly loved them. The knit material on the top of the shoe hugs and conforms to your foot giving support but is not at all constrictive. Nowhere does the shoe rub against the skin so it is a shoe that is not blister causing.

I feel like I could definitely break a heel in these and fall flat on my face not to mention they feel like stilts lol granted I do not normally wear any shoes with a heel or wedge so I need practice walking in these kind of shoes.I don\\'t like how the shoe itself is matte suede (or whatever it\\'s made out of) and the heel is shiny plastic it just kills it for me I wish the heel was also covered with the same material. I hadn\\'t noticed in the picture either way, I just assumed it was a given the heel would match the color and material as the shoe and as I said I don\\'t buy many pairs of high heels so I guess that\\'s my fault. I should\\'ve paid closer attention. Heel is also lighter in color compared to the material covering the shoe. That is the only aesthetic feature I don\\'t like.Other than that, they look okay.

According to the info printed on the Large sole, it will take US 8 - 9, Eur 39 - 40 or UK 6 - 7. The fit is rather like that of low-cut socks with super-thick soles - I\\'d call it a snug hug - and there is some room for give and take, though if you\\'re anything above US 9, I think you\\'d be better off with the next size up.I won\\'t belabour the point about the comfort, which is most certainly there.

My foot is normal/medium in width and gets much narrower at the heel.I am deciding between these and a pair of Vince Camuto Ellen ballet flats, both in red. I like the true red of the Bloch flats in Rojo a bit better than the slightly orange-toned red of the Ellen flats as the former seems more versatile. But the Ellen flats are much more comfortable out of the box than the Arabians. I was kind of surprised that the Bloch flats are not as soft as they appear in the pictures. They don\\'t have as much give as you might think. The toe box and heel area in particular feel rather hard on the inside. I can tell right away that these shoes are going to scrape the heck out of the back of my ankle and probably cause blisters if I wear them on a normal workday.On the other hand, the toe is a lovely oval shape (a little more elongated than the typical round-toed ballet flat), which is flattering. The sole is bigger/wider than the soles on the Ellen flats, which makes me believe these will wear a little bit better. The shoe is 100 leather (upper, lining and sole) which lets your feet breathe.I\\'m not sure if I want to gamble on these becoming more comfortable after a breaking-in period as they are still kind of pricey for flats, even on sale.

Finally I decided to buy them all the same, and I\\'m glad I did. I will admit that the calves are a little tight, and if you have larger calves then you might as well forget it. The shoe is true to size though (I always wear a 9 and the 9 in this boot fit perfectly)and while they were initially tight and difficult to zip up on my normal sized calves (about 15 around), the boots got used to my legs after just three wears and now the boots zip up easily and they fit comfortably on my calves.The boot material is far thicker than I thought it would be, the PU upper closely resembles a shiny leather, and they feel very sturdy around my ankles. Overall the boots look far more expensive than they are. One of my more fashion conscious friends thought I had spent four times the boots\\' price on my pair because they thought the boots looked like actual leather at first glance. If you are used to wearing 4-4.5 heels then you will find these both comfortable and easy to walk in once you break the ankles in. They could use a little more padding under the balls of your feet, but they by no means kill your feet without additional inserts. I wear them at the office without a problem. Learning to drive with these boots on was a little touchy at first, but after one extended wear the ankles broke in enough that it hasn\\'t been much of an issue since. All in all I am very very pleased with my purchase and will not hesitate to buy another pair when my current pair wears out.\",\"title\":\"Well worth the price\",\"username\":\"Amazon Customer\"}]',\n",

So I cannot size up 1/2 size as I wish I could. Secondly, my feet are slightly on the narrow side. The toes of the shoe are narrow, not very tall (so they pinch down on my foot) and on top of all of that, they aren\\'t true to size in length. The top of the toes do not have the soft, fuzzy lining. They instead have a firmer fabric that I do not find comfortable at all. Instead of feeling like I\\'m wearing comfortable slippers, I feel like I\\'m squishing into a pair of too small, pointy heels. There is no wiggle room. From my big toe to my pinky, all toes are pinched in EVERY direction. They fit me like a 9 would (so a full size smaller). What a HUGE disappointment. I couldn\\'t wear these long enough to even see if they stretch, they\\'re that uncomfortable and I know an 11 would be too big and wouldn\\'t stay on my heel. :-( Also, the memory foam sole is so thin that it\\'s really not THAT noticeable.

The heel is really quite comfortable and I don\\'t find the tag on the bottom of the foot to be noticeable without socks.**UPDATE: Returned and purchased Old Friend Women\\'s Bella Slipper for TEN dollars cheaper than the current price.

I had been wearing a cheaper version clog that looked much like this. With those, though I could only wear them for about 3 weeks and the bottoms would wear. For 20, I got 6 months of use with these, and they are not slippery on the bottom, like the ones I was wearing. Some folks (probably women) mentioned they are wide, but that\\'s normal for a unisex shoe since men\\'s shoes are wider than women\\'s -- and this shoe is made to be unisex. I need to wear shoes that aren\\'t hard on my feet, as I have sensation problems. Plus, one foot is a bit crooked, since some reconstruction surgery, after a broken foot. In the 6 months I wore the first pair, there was nearly undetectable wear on the bottom, they don\\'t slip, and I wore them every day. They are comfortable, and though I wondered initially about the bumps on the inside they were no issue. I always wore socks with them, and since they are synthetic I think they would be uncomfortable without. The vents toward the back of the shoe aren\\'t necessary, in my estimation. That\\'s actually the weak point, and what tore this week (on the outside vent, of the shoe worn on my crooked foot.) They do get a little dull over time, and I think I will take the advice mentioned in one of the other reviews -- to get some of the stuff used to make tires shine. At this point, I\\'ll assume 6 months of wear per pair. My plan is to buy another pair in 3 months or so, and then I\\'ll have an everyday pair and a good pair.

I wanted footwear that I could easily slip into, especially when in a hurry to get out the door. I am an avid Crocs wearer but wanted a style that was more versatile and that could pass as a regular shoe, and which had more over-all coverage of the foot. These Tredsafe shoes really fit the bill. The arch support and cushy softness of the sole is similar to Crocs clogs, so very nice. My normal foot size is a 12 D. These apparently only come in wide width but the fit is snug with no pressure on the toes. The toe box in fact has the roominess of an Earth Shoe without the outlandish look, (for those of you who remember the \\'70\\'s). The left shoe fit my foot perfectly but the right one has a very slight lift in the heel. Not an issue as it does not rub or lift much and seems to be self-adjusting. If I have to, I may need to put in a heel cup to resolve this slight issue. For those of you who wish to have a very versatile shoe that is very comfortable, easy to put on and take off, easy to clean, and, (hopefully) will last a long time at a very affordable price - then, this product is a dream come true.

I am an avid Crocs wearer but wanted a style that was more versatile and that could pass as a regular shoe, and which had more over-all coverage of the foot. These Tredsafe shoes really fit the bill. The arch support and cushy softness of the sole is similar to Crocs clogs, so very nice. My normal foot size is a 12 D.

The toe box in fact has the roominess of an Earth Shoe without the outlandish look, (for those of you who remember the \\'70\\'s). The left shoe fit my foot perfectly but the right one has a very slight lift in the heel. Not an issue as it does not rub or lift much and seems to be self-adjusting. If I have to, I may need to put in a heel cup to resolve this slight issue. For those of you who wish to have a very versatile shoe that is very comfortable, easy to put on and take off, easy to clean, and, (hopefully) will last a long time at a very affordable price - then, this product is a dream come true.

I decided to give these shoes a try, and I\\'m so glad I did! It makes sense--you would never wear tennis shoes to go running (OK, maybe you would, but you shouldn\\'t!)--you need to wear proper footwear for each sport or fitness activity. Zumba is very different than many aerobic fitness activities, and that is why you need to have the right shoes. The cushioning is different than in other athletic shoes, and the soles are suited for those twisty Zumba moves. Part of the sole is a harder rubber to make twisting easier. If you think about it, other athletic shoes are designed to grip (i.e. no twisting or sliding)--you don\\'t want that in Zumba! You want just enough grip so you don\\'t go ice skating across the gym floor, but you want to be able to twist, slide, etc. with ease. Wearing the right kind of shoe is important! I didn\\'t realize how important until I tried them!Zumba sells its own brand of shoes--at a premium price (on Amazon they are 30+ more than these shoes, which are made by a company specializing in dance wear). No need to do that! If you feel you MUST wear something that says Zumba on it, buy a shirt! It costs less than the shoe (although those shirts are pricey too).I tried these shoes on at a dance store, but decided to think about it--I had not looked at reviews or done any research. I\\'m glad I decided to check out Amazon--this company sells this shoe for 20 less than the dance store.The sizes do run SMALL--the advice from other reviewers to go 1 1/2 sizes UP from your normal shoe size was good. Best thing to do, though, is to try on this shoe at a store (wear the socks you would wear at Zumba!), then purchase the shoe on Amazon from this company.\",\"title\":\"Now I can Zumba all I want!\",\"username\":\"Homeschool Mom\"},{\"date\":\"2011-12-30T06:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2016-05-17T04:11:27Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-06-11T05:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Bloch-Wave-Dance-Sneaker-8-5/dp/B0059A2BTO\"],\"text\":\"The sizing was ok for me.
