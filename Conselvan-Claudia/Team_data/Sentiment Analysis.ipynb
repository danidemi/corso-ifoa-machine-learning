I like that there is an extra panel of some kind of really tough material on the back end of the shoe. I would not recommend use in deep snow or water, these shoes are not as high topped as winter or hunting boots. These shoes are not extra insulated for cold weather.

I purchased them because for me the fit seemed ideal...not to loose nor too tight. With no half sizes made from 11 and up I was concerned they would either be too long or too short. But, for me, normally an 11 1/2, size 12 worked well. Most boots can be \\\\\\\\\"rocks\\\\\\\\\" when you try them on but these have great cushioning and very generous insoles for comfort and support. With a little use they have become even more comfortable. My only initial complaint would be that the top lace posts are placed a little too close to the top of the boot tongue so that the laces tended to slip up and over onto my socks. With use however I haven\\'t found it a problem. With steel toe boots I have always found that the leather over the steel would tear or wear away leaving the steel visible.

This caused a great deal of discomfort on my tendons. For $100+ pair of slippers and Ugg brand, they should last much longer than 2 months. I reached out to Ugg, and they were great to replace the slippers. I exchanged for the EXACT same slippers. Now that I am on my 2nd pair, they are still as comfortable as ever.

Only things to improve (and these may have been improved in the Clifton 2) are the toe box feels tight even though I have narrow feet. And the tongue on the original Clifton is too flimsy. So it takes a little getting used to. I think the new Cliftons will be better in that area. Last thing, this comes with two insoles.

This is why I was so surprised by the absolute epic fail of the Storm Mid Waterproof boot while out for a six-day hike along the Appalachian Trail. Previously I had used these boots in two shorter Pinhoti Trail shake-down hikes of 6 and 12 miles respectively after purchasing them our local outfitter. The boots needed to be broken in and no problems arose. The boots saved that for when I was on the much harder Appalachian trail and carrying a heavier load (~ 30# with food + water) along steeper ascents and descents. There were three major failures in the backcountry: 1) The waterproofing gusset between the tongue and the laces dug in to both ankles that would make each step a torturous experience (Ankles swelled so much you couldn\\'t see them); 2) The boots do not breathe - at all, causing moisture from sweat to accumulate despite wearing Wigwam socks, liners and Gold Bond powder. Problems manifested in the biggest blister I\\'ve ever had; and, 3) The tread has already started to separate from the bottom of the boot despite only hiking less than 50 miles in to them. I had just purchased them less than 3 months before the long AT hike. The problems manifested after the first major ascent some 5 miles in to the hike (Winding Stair Gap) and then progressively got worse. Luckily 26 miles in to the hike I came across the Nantahala Outdoor Center and was able to swap out my North Face boots for a pair of similar priced competitor boots. These boots affirmed the problems associated with the North Face Storm Mid Waterproof boots. While similarly priced none of the problems above occurred during the next 30 or so miles to Fontana Dam, our terminus point for this particular section hike. Given the above your money is better spend on a different pair of boots.\",\"title\":\"Unfortunate Boot Fail on Appalachian Trail\",\"username\":\"BSADad\"},{\"dateAdded\":\"2017-01-12T05:29:58Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2017-01-11T00:00:00Z\"],\"didPurchase\":\"true\",\"doRecommend\":\"true\",\"sourceURLs\":[\"https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/151427641\"],\"text\":\"Use for work and for hiking on trails and through woods.\",\"title\":\"Like the boots very much.\",\"username\":\"None\"}]',\n",

The sheep skin suede isn\\'t as soft as it was, instead it feels a bit like cardboard which is kind of disappointing. The fur inside isnt as soft either. It looks and feels almost like the fake fur from knock off UGGS. Also the packaging is horrible. The way they align the cardboard inside the box to keep the shoes in place causes the boots to get scratches and trust me they are UGLY. I had to return my pair at my local UGG store, but even there the lady pulled out four pairs of these uggs only for them to have even worse scratches because of the cardboard dividers inside the box. I recommend buying the brush to smooth it out. It lessens the appearance of the scratches but they are still noticeable. Overall i thought these UGGS were really cute, but for the price of them, I wished UGGs would use the same quality material they did four years ago, other than that I think they are great for the winter and very cute to wear.

Never had much luck with their durability or comfort. But I\\'ve found myself only getting 3-4 months out of my last 2 pairs of $140 KEEN boots before they broke down. And my $250 Red Wing boots before those only lasted a year. On top of that I was really unhappy with the comfort level of the Red Wings even with different inserts. The KEENs are good in that respect. To be fair I\\'m a big guy. So I\\'m experimenting with these boots to see what I can get out of Dickies brand.I researched boots under $100 as much as I could before this purchase. The Dickies were mentioned favorably in one blog but not the Dickies job rated steel toe MAXX that I bought at Wal-Mart. I usually wear size 13 wide. But these boots are a 13 regular and the fit is amazing. Not sure if this is an anomaly or not but I can\\'t even tell these are steel toe boots. Great fit in every respect. Not tight anywhere even with wool socks on.Today makes 2 full days wearing them on concrete, gravel and uneven terrain. I did replace the original insoles with Spearco Polysorb Walker/Runner insoles but it was surprising how much better the original insoles were in these Dickies than the Herman Survivor Foreman boots I nearly bought until I tried these Dickies.At the end of the day today I came to the conclusion that, based on fit and comfort, I would actually recommend these boots. The long term longevity may be another matter. But from what I see from the boots construction I believe they will meet or exceed the KEENs mentioned earlier. And if they do last at least 4 months then for me it will be a cost effective choice being half the price as the KEENs and nearly 1/4th the cost of the Red Wings.\",\"title\":\"First impressions GOOD\",\"username\":\"restoreclassics4u\"},{\"dateAdded\":\"2017-01-05T18:05:36Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-04-03T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.walmart.com/reviews/api/product/43160403?limit=20&page=1&sort=&filters=&showProduct=false\",\"https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/43160403\"],\"text\":\"Only 2 months old and the leather has already worn off the toe area!\",\"title\":\"Not worth the money,\",\"username\":\"Randy\"},{\"dateAdded\":\"2017-01-05T18:05:36Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-04-21T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.walmart.com/reviews/api/product/43160403?limit=20&page=1&sort=&filters=&showProduct=false\",\"https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/43160403\"],\"text\":\"Good\",\"title\":\"Good\",\"username\":\"Jimbo\"},{\"dateAdded\":\"2017-01-05T18:05:36Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-04-14T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.walmart.com/reviews/api/product/43160403?limit=20&page=1&sort=&filters=&showProduct=false\",\"https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/43160403\"],\"text\":\"This by far is the most comfortable pair of work boots that Walmart sells.they are waterproof like it says.

But I am still wearing the first pair daily. There is nothing wrong with the first boots with the exception of one boot lace wearing out. I was at Wal-Mart and saw they had my size again so I bought a new pair.One big reason these boots last is the real stitching around the perimeter of the boot AND the additional stitching on the soles of the boots (turn them over and look) at the toe and midway back on the sides where the boot bends.These boots, besides being well built, are really comfortable right out of the box. And they remain so as time goes on. The Herman Survivors Wal-Mart sells, that look somewhat comparable to the Dickies, do not compare in any way. So don\\'t be fooled. For a steel toed work boot these Dickies Maxx boots are great.There are 2 areas that you may need to address though. One is waterproofing but that is easy. The other is the wear you will experience at the toe leather covering the steel insert. You may experience significant wear due to leather at this area which is a bit soft. But I coat the toes with Kg\\'s BOOT GUARD. Available in several colors and, if applied per the directions, will make the toes last for the life of the boot. I pay $11 locally for it.I wrote this review because we can\\'t all afford $200+ work boots and its a real challenge sorting through the choices. I choose to wear these boots because they are truly worth the money. I know. I am 60+ years old and have worn boots all my life.

They worked great. As a DIY guy I will probably use them for roofing too. As far as fit, I bought mine one half size bigger to accommodate neoprene socks. There is something I should mention however. My ankles tend to roll in and though this shoe is basketball cut, it did not provide enough support for my condition. I added an arch support (Sole\\'s) since the shoe is nearly flat inside. When I first opened the box the shoes looked straight, but after a few miles the uppers sogged over conforming to my crooked ankles, rather than the other way around. In the Narrows they held onto slippery rocks well, but they stayed wet until the next day. Nevertheless, hiking around after emerging from the Narrows I did not hear the dreaded squish squish sound, so that was good. After the trip I examined the bottoms and several of the lugs or poka-dot projections near the heel had worn away completely. The actual rubber is quite thin. These shoes are very comfortable despite the above, and while my feet got tired after a full day of hiking, I cannot help but like them. They are lightweight and stylish.

It comes in a very nice gift box, with black velvet, which makes a nice presentation. It looks very close to a white gold and feels much the same.I received a size 14 and I tested it, and it is absolutely true to a size 14. Sometimes people are advised to get a half size up with a wide band, but this one fits true to size, so if you wear a 12, get a 12. It is smooth and very well made, without any irregularities or defects in the finish. The engraving along the center feels very smooth,and the bevel at the top and bottom of the outside of the ring is very reflective and gives it a nice shine. Inside it is completely rounded and smooth, so it is very comfortable to wear.If you are into the \\'lore\\' of metals, like we are, you will enjoy the association of tungsten with strength and protection. I think those are very nice quality to associate with a marriage.Though the metal is very hard and durable, it can be broken in case of emergency or swelling with a common adjustable vice grip. Just put it on the ring and slowly adjust the pressure until it cracks. Then another partial turn should break it, so these rings are safe as well as beautiful.\",\"title\":\"Very comfortable ring, with nice weight and feel, looks much more expensive than it is quite durable\",\"username\":\"Kristi Gilleland\"}]',\n",

I tried a cheaper model but I didn\\'t like how they felt so I went back to the Hyperdunks. I could not be happier about this decision. Shopping online has always been a little risky for me because I\\'m really picky and indecisive, especially when it comes to shoes. You\\'ll find that this model stays true to its size. I generally wear 12.5, so that\\'s what I ordered and they fit perfectly. I am now confident that I can always order these shoes when the time comes for a new pair.One of the biggest things that I was looking for in a basketball shoe was ankle support, for I have severely sprained my ankle three times. These shoes provide that support and are very comfortable with the way the tongue and heel sort of mold to your foot. The arch and cushion on the heel feel great when jumping and making cuts. I cannot comment on the durability, but in the past models it has been pretty average.I don\\'t think I need to review on the looks because if you scroll up you can see for yourself how stylish these shoes are. There is also a ton of cool color schemes for you to choose from. From the first time I tried these out I could immediately tell how awesome they were.

The dial is easy to read (even for older eyes, my Dad would like at add) and the nice band straps securely and comfortably. We tested the watch in various water situations, including cleaning off dive equipment in a pool all day, and it handled every situation just fine. The bonus tan strap is fine, not a personal favorite, but the black strap is regal looking and we got quite a lot of complements on the piece. Easy to use, easy to wear, really just flawless. Until you come to the manufacturing.This watch is made in China. The makers of the watch would really like you to not think about that. The words Swiss are plastered all over their promo materials that accompany the watch, as if just saying the word Swiss overcomes the watch not being made in actual Switzerland. The little info sheet inside the handsome watch case states : Our factory is SWISS OWNED and run with strict Swiss supervision with the overriding mission of maintaining the high standards previously set in Switzerland. For me, this conjures up a mental image of long rows of hapless workers making watches 15 hours a day as a Swiss man supervises them from neon-lit office. Icky. Swiss watches should be made in Switzerland, or not referred to as Swiss over and over. Companies move production to cheaper countries, but they do not pass on the savings to us, the consumers. They just make a better profit. The deceptive wording on the promo materials annoyed me enough to dock the product an entire star.In conclusion, the watch is beautiful.Read more\",\"title\":\"Beautiful and Functional Watch With Only One Drawback\",\"username\":\"CodeMaster Talon\"},{\"date\":\"2014-06-24T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2016-02-03T06:01:01Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-11-29T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Stuhrling-Original-555A-01-Classic-Quartz/dp/B00B2GZI1M\"],\"text\":\"The watch looks nice and I like the ease of changing the band.

But that didnt happen since the collar that surrounds the foot provides a firm hold. What I didnt expect was that the fabric used would wear through within three months! The fabric liner has a waffle texture which creates the friction to secure your sock and foot and it is this that has worn through.

I\\'ve tried other, what was supposed to be smart watches, and they were not off the bat that easy.Even though it worked off of the bat, I still plugged it in so that it could charge. It took about 45 minutes, and it was fully charged. Another bonus.Downloading apps is very simple, once you download the initial app. This watch is user-friendly, the interface is outstanding, and because it is so user-friendly, it makes it to where you want to use this watch instead of picking up your phone. The text messaging, is a lot of fun, especially when you use speech to text.I love that it is basically a Fitbit, without the huge price tag! It tracks your activity, reminds you to drink water, and it keeps track of your sleep. That\\'s kind of cool in itself.Switching from different screens is very easy, since it\\'s so similar to the Android phone, of course it works off the Android operating system, but the similarities between the phone and the watch are that the home screen is the same on here, the back button is the same. The menu button to get your apps to come up is pretty much the same, and scrolling through all of the pages for your apps on the watch is exactly the same as the Android operating system. I really do like that this is not limited to just Android users, that you are able to use this watch with an iPhone. I don\\'t think that it has the same capabilities with the iPhone as it does with the Android. But that\\'s only because the Apple operating system is completely different than the Android operating system.

But after more than a week with the U-Watch U8, I\\'m actually pretty darn pleased.To preface, the manufacturer sent me a sample of this device to review - this review is my honest opinion.So I should start off by mentioning that I\\'m an iPhone user, and although this smart-watch is intended mainly for android users, that doesn\\'t mean that we iPhone users are totally excluded. Sure, there\\'s a slight diminishment in functionality, but as I\\'ll discuss in the review, for the price you\\'re paying I think it\\'s worth it (or at least it is for me).Out of the box, you\\'ll need to charge your watch. It comes with a cable, although by this point I have so many USB chargers that I have a box for extra cables, and in this one went. I have found the silicone/rubber strap of this watch to be extremely comfortable, and right from the bat I knew that as far as comfort goes, I could easily wear this watch for days.INTERFACEBefore I go in to what this watch can and cannot do with an iPhone, I wanted to mention the interface. For those coming from android (I have a couple of android tablets laying around) the interface should be pretty familiar. There\\'s a select button on the far left (looks like a stack of papers), the center button (that looks like a switch window icon) is actually used for changing the volume of the watch, and finally there\\'s the far right button used for going back, with matching icon. On the side of the watch is a mechanical button used for turning on the display from power save, going back to the watch face if you\\'re in a menu (i.e. a home button function) as well as for putting the watch in power save mode.Read more\",\"title\":\"Review from an iPhone User\",\"username\":\"Ciaran\"},{\"date\":\"2015-05-11T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-02T21:06:20Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-02-09T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Acamar-Calculator-Wristwatch-Smartphones-Blackberry/dp/B00XHI8I1A\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Acamar-Wristwatch-Bracelet-Android-Samsung/dp/B00W3IKGUQ\"],\"text\":\"Nice looking.

It was amazingly fast, and I am surprised and happy about that. I\\'ve tried other, what was supposed to be smart watches, and they were not off the bat that easy.Even though it worked off of the bat, I still plugged it in so that it could charge. It took about 45 minutes, and it was fully charged. Another bonus.Downloading apps is very simple, once you download the initial app. This watch is user-friendly, the interface is outstanding, and because it is so user-friendly, it makes it to where you want to use this watch instead of picking up your phone. The text messaging, is a lot of fun, especially when you use speech to text.I love that it is basically a Fitbit, without the huge price tag! It tracks your activity, reminds you to drink water, and it keeps track of your sleep. That\\'s kind of cool in itself.Switching from different screens is very easy, since it\\'s so similar to the Android phone, of course it works off the Android operating system, but the similarities between the phone and the watch are that the home screen is the same on here, the back button is the same. The menu button to get your apps to come up is pretty much the same, and scrolling through all of the pages for your apps on the watch is exactly the same as the Android operating system. I really do like that this is not limited to just Android users, that you are able to use this watch with an iPhone. I don\\'t think that it has the same capabilities with the iPhone as it does with the Android. But that\\'s only because the Apple operating system is completely different than the Android operating system. I personally think that the Android operating system is way more user friendly.Read more\",\"title\":\"This can be for a man or a woman, the size is perfect for Unisex! 7 of 8 people found this helpful.

My original Gold Toe socks from Dillard\\'s are still going strong and feel great (though dingier from the long time I\\'ve had them).I was thinking that maybe I got some socks that were made different for non-retail stores (Wal-Mart\\'s been known to do that - get manufacturers to cut quality to meet Wal-Mart\\'s pricing demands), so I went back to the Dillard\\'s that I bought the originals from tonight to see if the Gold Toes there were like the ones I bought at Kohl\\'s.Read more\",\"title\":\"NOOOO!

The first was probably 15 or more years ago. They lasted 14 years by only using them in the gym. I am a martial artist and gym rat so I like the concept of the shoe\\'s design.When I got my second pair about 6 months ago, within one day the entire fabric lining the sole insert peeled off! Duh, OK. So I added in running inserts which I had lying around, and that did the trick even though I should have returned them. Since then no problems esp. since I use these shoes kicking a very big, heavy bag.That\\'s why I decided to get another pair so that I don\\'t destroy my second pair in record time with all the kicking.Well, the third pair, purple color and nice looking, had a malfunction in the first week. The shoestring eyelet, the large plastic piece about half-way up the shoe snapped like a winter branch...while I was lacing the shoe up for Pete\\'s sake!Now, I should return them but it\\'s just more time and expense to do it. So I\\'m content to keep them since the snapped eyelet doesn\\'t affect performance-which for me is kicking and moving around the gym-no big deal. But it\\'s total BS that they should both have quality issues right out of the box.I at first suspected that it may have been a knockoff but the receipt came from Otomix so not likely. More likely is the s***ty manufacturing process in China where these shoes are made. Once again. Can anyone say Doc MartinWhile these are way better than the Chinese version of Doc Martin I am still suspect. Folks, that\\'s two big(ish) quality issues, within the first week on both new pairs of shoes. It bugs me because these shoes are not cheap, and based on my first pair, may not be as durable.Read more\",\"title\":\"CHEAPENED BY CHINESE MANUFACTURING\",\"username\":\"Chris Rasmussen\"},{\"date\":\"2015-03-27T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-02T00:17:51Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-02-06T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Otomix-Purple-Stingray-Weightlifting-Grappling/dp/B00MMN9FD6\"],\"text\":\"Been a fan of Otomix Stingray for years, it\\'s the only sneaker I will wear.

The first was probably 15 or more years ago. They lasted 14 years by only using them in the gym. I am a martial artist and gym rat so I like the concept of the shoe\\'s design.When I got my second pair about 6 months ago, within one day the entire fabric lining the sole insert peeled off! Duh, OK. So I added in running inserts which I had lying around, and that did the trick even though I should have returned them. Since then no problems esp. since I use these shoes kicking a very big, heavy bag.That\\'s why I decided to get another pair so that I don\\'t destroy my second pair in record time with all the kicking.Well, the third pair, purple color and nice looking, had a malfunction in the first week. The shoestring eyelet, the large plastic piece about half-way up the shoe snapped like a winter branch...while I was lacing the shoe up for Pete\\'s sake!Now, I should return them but it\\'s just more time and expense to do it. So I\\'m content to keep them since the snapped eyelet doesn\\'t affect performance-which for me is kicking and moving around the gym-no big deal. But it\\'s total BS that they should both have quality issues right out of the box.I at first suspected that it may have been a knockoff but the receipt came from Otomix so not likely. More likely is the s***ty manufacturing process in China where these shoes are made. Once again. Can anyone say Doc MartinWhile these are way better than the Chinese version of Doc Martin I am still suspect. Folks, that\\'s two big(ish) quality issues, within the first week on both new pairs of shoes. It bugs me because these shoes are not cheap, and based on my first pair, may not be as durable.Read more\",\"title\":\"CHEAPENED BY CHINESE MANUFACTURING 6 of 6 people found this helpful.

The issue is with most brands having logos on the ankle. Thankfully this sock has none and meets the regulation. I also own a verity high quality name brand athletic/running socks to compare these too and I can say these are the best I\\'ve tried. They have convenienced me to use them for both military and civilian use.The socks themselves are very comfortable. This is apparent from from the first time you slip them on your feet. You will not be disappointed with the quality and comfort of this sock for the price per pair. They fit quite snug but do not feel tight. They have ample padding on the soul of the sock which provides a cushioned feeling. There is an extra thick section covering the ball of your foot to help prevent blisters and improve comfort. The top portion of the sock is made of a thinner material. This helps relieve heat buildup. There is also a very thin, semi-permeable, layer on top of your toes to vent heat.The design of these socks allows for excellent comfort on long runs. The additional padding helps prevent hot spots and blisters. Because the socks have a snug fit and are constructed of great materials, I have never experienced any chafing from the seams of the fabric. These socks have proven to be especially great in inclement weather: in the early morning with dew on hot humid days, in rain storms, or cold weather - these socks perform. Other socks when wet can feel rough, but the material of these socks is finely woven and thick enough to prevent any increase sensitivity.Read more\",\"title\":\"Best PT socks for military.\",\"username\":\"Theo\"},{\"date\":\"2012-05-11T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-01T00:43:28Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-11-29T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Fox-River-Triathlon-Quarter-White/dp/B000IZQCEA\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Fox-River-Triathlon-Quarter-X-Large/dp/B000V17M9A\"],\"text\":\"Without doubt, the best socks I\\'ve ever had.

There are 4 models in the Nike Tiempo line, in order from least to most expensive: Rio, Genio, Legacy, and Legend 5. There are several reviews of the Nike Tiempo line available on Youtube, including ones by soccerreviewsforyou and soccer mall. The Rio runs about 25-45. It is made of synthetic materials, which don\\'t mold to the foot or breathe, and once my kids got serious about soccer I stopped buying them synthetic shoes. So I don\\'t know anything about the Rio, but if in other ways it is similar to the rest of the Tiempo line, it\\'s probably fine for a first-time player or for families on a budget. The Legend 5 runs about 160-200. No way am I buying a 200 shoe for a kid who\\'s going to outgrow it in 3-6 months, so our family has no experience with those either. They are kangaroo leather, which is supposedly softer than calfskin, and perhaps that\\'s worth it if you\\'re a high school soccer star or college player whose feet have stopped growing. The Genio runs 50-65 and the Legacy runs 65-100 (keep eyes open for sales when colors get discontinued). They are both very comfortable shoes. So far neither of my kids have had any problems with discomfort or blisters, even right out of the box. (My younger son has gotten blisters with other Nike cleats, even after a few weeks of breaking in, and my older son has wide feet and often has trouble finding shoes to fit.) Both Genio and Legacy run one full size smaller in the length than regular shoes, but the width is medium. The Legacy leather is softer than the Genio, so it\\'s more accommodating for wide feet. Genio isn\\'t really stiff, but it does need a little breaking in.Read more\",\"title\":\"Comfortable mid-level leather cleat, runs 1 full size small\",\"username\":\"Julie\"}]',\n",

This watch costs less that what you would most likely pay for a watchband by itself. With that in mind I was not expecting very much when I ordered it, and when it arrived I was not surprised. I set the time and pushed the side knob in - but nothing happened. The watch did not start working like you would expect. I hit the face a couple of times and then the second hand started to move. This is not a quality watch, but it DOES look nice. I bought it precisely because of the faceted glass (plastic) dial. My old watchband broke, and because it was made in such a way that it was not replaceable, I set out to look for a temporary replacement, until the new Apple Watch is released. That should be in a month or two, so if this watch lasts a couple of months, then it would have achieved its purpose.Bottom line For what this watch cost it\\'s OK. If you plan to wear it just on the weekend, or once or twice a week, then it should be OK for you. I would not buy this watch as your daily watch though. It probably won\\'t last very long if you do that. The actual watch mechanism inside is very small. I wanted to replace the battery with a better one. What I saw inside was a tiny chip smaller than a dime (see pic below). The battery (number 377A) found here https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Silver-Batteries-SR626SW-SR626W/dp/B000IX2JOY/refsr13aitieUTF8qid1470865524sr8-3keywordswatch+battery+377+376 will ironically cost around the same price as the watch AND the watchband combined. That should tell you something. It\\'s a great looking watch, it\\'s just not designed to last very long.

It keeps good time and is genuine Quartz (battery) movement. it looks pretty cool unless you have pesky friends who insist on examining your wrist-bearing black-thingy up close. It may be thin and light-weight, but no watch connoisseur will mistake it for the precision movement and meticulously machine-honed metal of a wafer-thin Skagen.But, most importantly, this is not the watch for someone who takes every small problem with the watch band to a jeweler. First, most jewelers are too knowledgable to nick you for a high-priced cleaning or repair of the internal clock-work. Second, most jewelers will insist on selling you a band costing five times the price of the watch in addition to installing it with a strong spring-pin for a total of 15-20 bucks.In sum, this is a watch for someone who can deal with problems with the strap at either end. If it\\'s the strap at the 6:00 end, the only problem that will develop--within months or just a few days--is with the strap coming loose at the bottom of the watch. You can pop the existing string bar back in place (it helps to have a spring-bar removal tool--often included with some of the replacement straps and repair kits shown on Amazon). If it\\'s the top 12:00 strap, you\\'re faced with two potential (or rather inevitable) problems: first, the spring-pin could pop loose at the upper end of the watch. (Have extra spring bars, on hand--they\\'re cheap, and one can be lost in a split second) second, the clasp on these watches is made of thin metal, along with the little center pin that must fit into one of the holes in the upper, joining band.Read more\",\"title\":\"Actually, a stylish and sound watch providing you can remain strapped (and not stripped) 3 people found this helpful.

Lots of different colors and modes. It can just be a constant color, or flashing and also fading in and out. The only con I seen with them is that the color can change and one shoe is one color and the other shoe is a different color but its still cool. I also think that they are great for when bike riding or walking at night. You are safer because people can see you easily.

I ordered them March 31st and got them on my birthday (April 2nd). When I tracked my order it said it would be ship to my home at 8:00pm, instead it came way earlier than that like at noon which was awesome. Besides that people been loving my shoes everywhere I go. On a full charge they stay lit up for 10 hours which is also good. Everybody will stop and ask me where I got them from or just stop me to give me a compliment. My job is a fundraising company we deliver cookie dough to elementary schools and the kids will go crazy when they see my shoes. Overall I\\'m very satisfied, and even with the shoes not lit up they still look cool. I\\'ve ordered the metallic silver ones and they look so good in the dark or night time. Highly recommend these over any other light up shoes on Amazon. I\\'ve had a previous light up shoe but the charger broke and sometimes they battery would come out on the inside of the soles. But with these new shoes I don\\'t have that problem. Simple advice I would be careful plugging them up and unplugging them because the charger port can easily break which leaves you with 2 wires. And try not to jump in these shoes, one of the lights on the bottom may not light up anymore.

The first thing I noticed is they are incredibly light (the Ultrascendor was quite heavy). The quality of the leather is very good (quite soft). There is a very good rubber toe cap. I would like more ankle support in this shoe. I do not use this shoe to play tennis and do not believe it would give me the support in the ankle that I would need.

At 89.99 these shoes durable, perform well when on your feet, and are aesthetically pleasing.Continuing durability of these shoes is due to a couple key aspects of the design. The mesh design of the shoe flexes and doesnt fray or tear easily, meaning that your shoe will last. This shoe is outfitted with strong laces, so you dont have to worry about them fraying or failing on you while youre working out.Excellent performance is a trait of these shoes. The mesh lets your feet breathe, cutting down on blisters and hot spots. The sole is made from a flexible and lightweight material that provides for free movement in addition to the mobility that the synthetic mesh provides. The sole of the shoe is cut into hexagonal pods that allow the shoe to flex more naturally with your foot. One other important aspect of this shoe that the sole adds to is the traction. Its made out of a soft rubber that greatly improves the grip that you have while wearing this shoe.Sleek-looking design is another area where this shoe excels. The black body contrast well with the white Nike swoosh so that it sticks out more. Also, the minimalized tongue and mesh and sole that conform to your foot make the shoe look less substantial and more versatile.There are, however, a couple of aspects that are detrimental that you should think about when purchasing.1. The flat, soft rubber bottom grip, when worn outside on pavement or in dirt or grass, of the shoe can be damaged.Read more\",\"title\":\"Good, Reliable Shoe by Nike\",\"username\":\"Amazon Customer\"},{\"date\":\"2016-02-12T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2016-03-27T18:08:07Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-04-15T00:00:00Z\"],\"rating\":5.0,\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Free-Trainer-Mens-Style/dp/B00X6I3ZD2\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Free-Trainer-Mens-Style/dp/B00X6I3JJ2\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Free-Trainer-Mens-Style/dp/B00X6I3WTY\"],\"text\":\"I purchased the Nike Men\\'s Free TR 5.0 v6\\'s about 4 months ago for cardio, weight, and athletic training. I\\'m 24 years old and very active, so fit, durability, and quality were at the top of my list when I was looking for a training shoe. When I made the decision to purchase this pair of shoes, the quality and fit were above my expectations, so I was already satisfied with the purchase. After a few weight lifting sessions and some agility training, I was surprised that I didn\\'t have any foot soreness. Typically with a new pair of shoes, especially athletic tennis shoes, my feet get pretty sore in certain areas until they break-in. In terms of durability, these shoes definitely lived up to the quality I was seeing when I decided to purchase them. The sole of the shoes are cut for flexibility and have grip on the toe and heel, which allow for maximum grip. This grip feature is great for any type of training from cardio to weightlifting. Additionally, the shoe is mostly made of mesh, which gives the shoe breathability and additional comfort. The only blemish to this shoe is the fact that there is not much cushion to the sole, which is not good for long distance cardio or body support. I give this shoe 5 stars for a training shoe. The fit, durability, and overall quality are unmatched to anything I have seen. If you\\'re looking for a weight, agility, or athletic training shoe, this is it!

At 89.99 these shoes durable, perform well when on your feet, and are aesthetically pleasing.Continuing durability of these shoes is due to a couple key aspects of the design. The mesh design of the shoe flexes and doesnt fray or tear easily, meaning that your shoe will last. This shoe is outfitted with strong laces, so you dont have to worry about them fraying or failing on you while youre working out.Excellent performance is a trait of these shoes. The mesh lets your feet breathe, cutting down on blisters and hot spots. The sole is made from a flexible and lightweight material that provides for free movement in addition to the mobility that the synthetic mesh provides. The sole of the shoe is cut into hexagonal pods that allow the shoe to flex more naturally with your foot. One other important aspect of this shoe that the sole adds to is the traction. Its made out of a soft rubber that greatly improves the grip that you have while wearing this shoe.Sleek-looking design is another area where this shoe excels. The black body contrast well with the white Nike swoosh so that it sticks out more. Also, the minimalized tongue and mesh and sole that conform to your foot make the shoe look less substantial and more versatile.There are, however, a couple of aspects that are detrimental that you should think about when purchasing.1. The flat, soft rubber bottom grip, when worn outside on pavement or in dirt or grass, of the shoe can be damaged.Read more\",\"title\":\"Good, Reliable Shoe by Nike\",\"username\":\"Amazon Customer\"},{\"date\":\"2016-02-28T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2016-03-27T18:08:07Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-03-14T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Free-Trainer-Mens-Style/dp/B00X6I3WTY\"],\"text\":\"I like these.

I\\'m 24 years old and very active, so fit, durability, and quality were at the top of my list when I was looking for a training shoe. When I made the decision to purchase this pair of shoes, the quality and fit were above my expectations, so I was already satisfied with the purchase. After a few weight lifting sessions and some agility training, I was surprised that I didn\\'t have any foot soreness. Typically with a new pair of shoes, especially athletic tennis shoes, my feet get pretty sore in certain areas until they break-in. In terms of durability, these shoes definitely lived up to the quality I was seeing when I decided to purchase them. The sole of the shoes are cut for flexibility and have grip on the toe and heel, which allow for maximum grip. This grip feature is great for any type of training from cardio to weightlifting. Additionally, the shoe is mostly made of mesh, which gives the shoe breathability and additional comfort. The only blemish to this shoe is the fact that there is not much cushion to the sole, which is not good for long distance cardio or body support. I give this shoe 5 stars for a training shoe. The fit, durability, and overall quality are unmatched to anything I have seen. If you\\'re looking for a weight, agility, or athletic training shoe, this is it! If you\\'re looking a cardio shoe, keep looking.\",\"title\":\"Fantastic pair of training shoes!!!\",\"username\":\"Ricky Bennett\"},{\"date\":\"2016-01-02T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2016-03-27T18:08:07Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-01-09T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Mens-Trainer-Running-Shoes/dp/B00X8QIZBE\"],\"text\":\"I ordered the wrong size, and sent them back.\",\"title\":\"Five Stars\",\"username\":\"Donna Parris\"}]',\n",

Go one size up on these I bought a medium that fits well. It\\'s not loose around the band. The drawstrings are just for show. I have larger thighs and rear and they somewhat bind when you walk. So for me, I\\'ve noticed I\\'d adjust them every so often. I do wish the inseam would run down another inch. When I wear them, the inseam looks like it\\'s about an inch shorter than the model.- How do they feelThey are very comfortable. It\\'s a lycra material feel. Though I do feel that they could use a bit of thicker material. While you\\'re swimming, these hug your waist unlike other brand where water would enter the trunk through your back.- ConsFor the self conscience, you have to be rather fit to wear these trunks. If not fit, have a flat stomach. The waist band sits a few few inches below your navel. For men, we store our body fat there.

It feels very weak when winding and leaves the impression that the first time it gets even a glancing blow that it will snap. The look is fine and as described but the winding stem, considering that it does not (properly) have any stem guard or lugs is just an accident waiting to happen.

One of the first things I noticed about this shoe was the superior craftsmanship and design. They are not your average, run-of-the-mill gym shoes. They look like they could take a lot of abuse and still last a long time. I was lucky to get these on a special deal at Woot, but I would be willing to pay more for this type of quality. I have bought several pairs of athletic shoes lately that have prematurely separated at the soles and quality has become a top priority in my purchases. If you take a close look at the pictures, especially the side views, you can see the quality I am referring to. I think a lot of us are learning that cheaper isn\\'t always a good deal if something doesn\\'t last.Two of the main design differences from other athletic shoes are the amount of lateral support and the durability on the front and sides of the shoe. In order to have superior lateral support and keep your feet from sliding inside the shoes, during rapid movement and sudden change of directions, they must wrap around the foot. This is where people will differ on their opinion of the shoe. Some people will find the firm support around the foot great and others may find them too restrictive. The enhanced lateral support is great for preventing the shoe from rolling to the sides and would also help people suffering from any sprains or strains in the feet or ankles. Basically these shoes are designed to keep your foot in the proper position throughout all kinds of extreme movement. They feel like a compression shoe.Read more\",\"title\":\"Superior Shoe with a Specific design\",\"username\":\"John P.\"},{\"date\":\"2015-02-25T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-02T01:04:06Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-01-19T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Head-Revolt-Court-White-Yellow/dp/B00P8BA58S\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Head-Mens-Revolt-Tennis-Yellow/dp/B00T9JC53I\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Head-Mens-Revolt-Tennis-Yellow/dp/B00T9JC5AG\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Head-Revolt-Court-White-Yellow/dp/B00P8BA1XC\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Head-Mens-Revolt-Tennis-Yellow/dp/B00P8BA0Z6\"],\"text\":\"Shoes felt great walking inside the house at first.

One of the first things I noticed about this shoe was the superior craftsmanship and design. They are not your average, run-of-the-mill gym shoes. They look like they could take a lot of abuse and still last a long time. I was lucky to get these on a special deal at Woot, but I would be willing to pay more for this type of quality. I have bought several pairs of athletic shoes lately that have prematurely separated at the soles and quality has become a top priority in my purchases. If you take a close look at the pictures, especially the side views, you can see the quality I am referring to. I think a lot of us are learning that cheaper isn\\'t always a good deal if something doesn\\'t last.Two of the main design differences from other athletic shoes are the amount of lateral support and the durability on the front and sides of the shoe. In order to have superior lateral support and keep your feet from sliding inside the shoes, during rapid movement and sudden change of directions, they must wrap around the foot. This is where people will differ on their opinion of the shoe. Some people will find the firm support around the foot great and others may find them too restrictive. The enhanced lateral support is great for preventing the shoe from rolling to the sides and would also help people suffering from any sprains or strains in the feet or ankles. Basically these shoes are designed to keep your foot in the proper position throughout all kinds of extreme movement. They feel like a compression shoe.Read more\",\"title\":\"Superior Shoe with a Specific design 1 of 1 people found this helpful.

The box they came in had 2 sets of removable Soles (Snow Trac - for all around use, all through they are absolutely lousy on icy conditions, and the heavier duty Ice Trac which are great on any ice surface- these are a must have for icy driveways, hiking, etc.).The soles are not for the weak of heart trying to get switched out for another setup. The Sole has a rubber tang on the back that folds over the boot heel and slides on a metal button sticking out the back of the boot. The front of the sole slides into a flap in the front of the boot.To remove the sole you have to grab the rubber tang, unhinge it from the metal button and pull the sole from the 6 flanges (3 on each side) that are molded into the sole and peel the sole from the 6 slots that are imbedded in the mating part of the boot. This seems easy enough but most people may find this very difficult due to the slots in the bottom of the boots don\\'t give up that easy. It takes a lot of effort to unsnap the soles from the bottom of the boot. Getting them on is also a chore because they have to be pounded in place with the heal of your hand to get them to snap in the slot completely- not fun when you have the metal cleats to deal with.The problem I have now is 3 days after using these Icetrac soles they broke along the middle plastic part of the pad (right where the insignia is) and according to their website only the boot has a 12 month warranty. Any accessories (interchangeable soles) are not covered. I strongly suggest you log into their website and sign up for the free warranty.

In fact I\\'ve been wearing the tr line of shoes for many years/generations and I love them.... But it was time for a new pair...My first impression was that it was really nice and comfortable, I wear a 45 and have a wide foot and this fit well. The toe box is a little longer than the tr-59 but pretty similar fit overall. The addition of the toe strap is nice but to be honest I think I will never play with it now that I set it to my liking. The main strap is nice and provides plenty of leverage to close up the shoes really tight but still comfortable.Now let\\'s talk about the blue elephant in the room.... These shoes are embarrassing to wear. I like to impress people with my power, speed and form not my sparkling blue shoes. On the plus side they are very visible to drivers and I know this because I could see them point and laugh at me.I\\'m also pretty sure that if I have mechanical problems I\\'ll be able to tap my heels three times and be transported back home.Despite all this.... Great shoe... Butt ugly***** Update after using it for over a month *****So i\\'ve put about a 1000 miles on these shoes and figured i\\'d give an update1) They have become super comfortable and are great for my wide feet.2) I\\'m a pretty big guys ( 210 ) and can put some good force on these shoes and when i\\'m out of the saddle and pushing really hard i can feel the sole flex... My older TR\\'s never did that , so it seems that they skimped a little on the strength/stiffness of these shoes in favor of weight... It\\'s not really noticeable 99.5 of the time... but I expect a perfect show for this price.3) Still ugly as Sin*** END OF UPDATE ****\",\"title\":\"Good shoe but as ugly as it gets 1 of 3 people found this helpful.

There are 4 models in the Nike Tiempo line, in order from least to most expensive: Rio, Genio, Legacy, and Legend 5. There are several reviews of the Nike Tiempo line available on Youtube, including ones by soccerreviewsforyou and soccer mall. The Rio runs about 25-45. It is made of synthetic materials, which don\\'t mold to the foot or breathe, and once my kids got serious about soccer I stopped buying them synthetic shoes. So I don\\'t know anything about the Rio, but if in other ways it is similar to the rest of the Tiempo line, it\\'s probably fine for a first-time player or for families on a budget. The Legend 5 runs about 160-200. No way am I buying a 200 shoe for a kid who\\'s going to outgrow it in 3-6 months, so our family has no experience with those either. They are kangaroo leather, which is supposedly softer than calfskin, and perhaps that\\'s worth it if you\\'re a high school soccer star or college player whose feet have stopped growing. The Genio runs 50-65 and the Legacy runs 65-100 (keep eyes open for sales when colors get discontinued). They are both very comfortable shoes. So far neither of my kids have had any problems with discomfort or blisters, even right out of the box. (My younger son has gotten blisters with other Nike cleats, even after a few weeks of breaking in, and my older son has wide feet and often has trouble finding shoes to fit.) Both Genio and Legacy run one full size smaller in the length than regular shoes, but the width is medium. The Legacy leather is softer than the Genio, so it\\'s more accommodating for wide feet. Genio isn\\'t really stiff, but it does need a little breaking in.Read more\",\"title\":\"Comfortable mid-level cleat, runs 1 full size small\",\"username\":\"Julie\"},{\"date\":\"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2016-05-17T01:35:52Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-01-08T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Tiempo-Leather-Strike-Soccer/dp/B00Q5LUWS8\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Tiempo-Genio-Leather-Soccer/dp/B00VKWDO8W\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Tiempo-Leather-Strike-Soccer/dp/B00Q5LUPXA\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Tiempo-Leather-Strike-Soccer/dp/B00Q5LUJSG\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Tiempo-Leather-Ground-Soccer/dp/B00D928DH8\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Tiempo-Leather-Strike-Soccer/dp/B00Q5LXF1E\"],\"text\":\"Like these Nikes mostly because Nike makes size 14 and 15.

Up until now I have rocked the Nike Free 3.0, but their designs have gotten a little out of control, so I thought I\\'d try the Adidas version. Glad I did. Cheaper than Nike, just as comfy (if not more so, time will tell), and not quite as over-designed.I wear a 16 in Nike, Asics, Adidas Originals, but apparently not in new Adidas. The 16 was very small. All 5 toes were deforming the end of the shoe. Aside from them being to small, they were super light, very cushy sole, and seemed to have great arch support. On top of very long feet, i also have very narrow and flat feet to boot. These run on the narrow side, and that is great for me.I returned the 16\\'s and ordered the 17\\'s.

WARNiNG, this leather version is extremely hard to find in your size, but well worth it...often it has a different name than slouch boot, but the product id is DI 5542...google around and you should be able to find a supplier in stock, tho they list them in stock but the shoe drop ships from dingo and they may be out of your size, and you find out days later.well worth the trouble to get. they have the same fit and design as this crappy leather black boot, but the durability of all other western boots. yes, both are made in china, as most leather cowboy boots today, but the ONLY problem with this black slouch boot was the paper thin falling apart leather...get the tan FULL leather version and in my opinion it is the best cowboy boot in the world for comfort and looks, with a full leather sole that can be replaced when worn...so the shoe should last you 20 years. not 20 minutes like this black pigskin version.\",\"title\":\"a flunkout\",\"username\":\"johnnyjohnny\"},{\"date\":\"2014-06-09T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-01T00:48:04Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-11-29T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Dingo-Mens-Slouch-Boot-Black/dp/B000YDG2O6\"],\"text\":\"When I first slipped these on, they felt kinda stiff.

The Boa closure is the nicest closure that I\\'ve felt in a cycling shoe, it snugs down evenly over the top of the foot and without any pinch points. On the road, it\\'s really easy to tighten or loosen as necessary with just a few clicks of the adjustment knob. These shoes seem to run a size or two smaller than normal shoes. I have a pair of Specialized mountain biking shoes in a size 42, which seem to fit true to size, and with the Fi\\'zi:k, I had to go to a 44 for proper fitment, which was perfect for the width, but a bit long for my liking.According to Fi\\'zi:k, the R5B is a bit heavier (25g) and not quite as high tech compared to the R3B. However, the R3B cost is a lot higher so you\\'ll have to decide if the weight advantage is worth the additional cost.My main reason for going with these is the Boa closure, I tried on other shoes with velcro straps and none felt as good as the Boa system.

I sized up by one half and that took care of the width issue I had in my normal size. But, the toe box is a little too roomy with the bigger size. They are still crazy comfortable and so far, I\\'ve only hiked with them a couple times, they are breaking in nicely and I can really tell how much more refreshed my legs and especially knees feel. At the price I paid (50) these are a terrific shoe!Original: These are good shoes, great materials and really top tier construction. But, they are really underwhelming for the price point. I returned them and purchased the Fast R GTX and saved money. I now have six shoes from the Terrex line and these do not have the same removable sock liners or body material. The upper materials are mesh, which is great for breath-ability, but awful if you are planning to encounter a lot of sand, dust and water. I do intend to purchase these again when the price drops significantly, or when they offer them with removable Ortholite sock liners and Goretex (Supposedly Fall \\'15), like their Fast and Swift counterparts. The fit was pretty solid, though they do run a tad narrow and I could see someone needed significant arch support, not being a fan of these. The Continental rubber outters, however, are the best I\\'ve ever seen. I have Continental on all but one of my other Terrex shoes and these are even better, with a more aggressive tread pattern and what I estimate to be a softer and tackier composite.All in all, I\\'m really glad to see the addition of Boost to the Terrex line. But, this first swing at it does not fit my needs. I would still recommend them and will always recommend Adidas Outdoors.

My current favorite pair of jeans. I like the fit through the hips and upper thigh where these jeans are slightly more trim than most but not at all tight for a guy with more or less average size thighs and pretty much no ass. If you\\'re familiar with Levi\\'s sizing, these jeans run slightly larger in the waist (a 33 is close to a 34 for Levis) and slightly shorter for the inseam (30 inch for these is about the same as 29 inch Levis). This was a bonus for me because apparently I have unusually short legs for a somewhat short dude. At 5\\'8 30 inch inseams are typically a little longer than I like but are also the shortest anyone other than Levis sells. I prefer not rolling the cuffs and not having them bunch up around my ankles when wearing shoes or getting sucked up under my heel when wearing flip flops. So my options are usually to deal with those inconveniences or buy 29 inseams from Levis. But this particular pair of Buffalo Bittons are the perfect length for anyone like me who usually wears a 29 and therefore has very limited buying options other than good old Levis.The preceding is based on sample size of one so far, so take it FWIW. I found a similar pair on sale at Macy\\'s online yesterday (the same style but not tumbled and damaged) and ordered size 32x30 since I\\'m trying to drop a few pounds and the 33 waist is already a little more room than I require for my current gut.

I have bought them for years and they have been excellent. This is the first pair of New Balance shoes I could not wear. There are three issues I have with these shoes: 1) The sizing is way too short. My toes hit the end of the shoes just standing in them. 2) My best walking shoes from New Balance are the 955\\'s which were sold as a country walker. I also have a couple pair of 928 walking shoes which are more comfortable than the 955\\'s due to their deeper toe box, but they do not offer as much support or protection as the 955 for walking on rougher terrain. I bought this pair to replace the 955\\'s since I noticed that the last they are made from offers a deeper toe box and they are marketed as both a walking shoe and a hiking shoe. But compared to the 955, these shoes have no where near the support. They perform more like a light tennis shoe and not at all like a hiking shoe. The shank and support of the 955 are totally missing. They are even less supportive than the 928\\'s. 3) The workmanship of the shoes is very poor compared to all my other New Balance shoes. Two of the top four lacing hooks, which are placed on the cuff of the shoe, stick under the leather to which the cuff is stitched. This makes it very difficult to lace the shoes. One has to put their fingers inside the shoe and push the cuff outwards to expose the hook in order to lace the shoes. Overall, this is a very disappointing shoe.\",\"title\":\"Poor Quality, Poor Sizing, Poor Support\",\"username\":\"Erik\"}]',\n",

They\\'re great for working out which is mainly why I bought them but they are also great to just lounge around or have a casual day in. I was worried that the bottom cuffs would maybe be too tight but they have more of a roomier elasticity and I find it perfect. The picture doesn\\'t do them justice either. In the picture the black pair look more of like a heathered black but I am here to confirm that is not the case. They are a normal deep shade of black.

I haven\\'t taken them off since they came in the mail today!I got these pants for the slim profile and warm material, and they do the job extremely well. I get the benefit of warmth on cool, windy days, without having the bagginess of regular jogging pants (a style I am not a fan of). The legs were a bit longer for my preference, but I ended up rolling the cuff in the pant leg and they still look good. They do have a tendency to slightly bunch on your backside, but it\\'s nothing worth worry about. As for quality, they seem to be well made, which I\\'m extremely happy about. Finding something similar in Nike or Adidas would usually set me back at least 40 dollars, but for nearly half the price and better warmth material (in my opinion), Champion is a great choice!If anything notable comes up, I\\'ll be sure to update the review.UPDATE! Just washed my joggers after having them for a week and after drying them, they did shrink! Not in length, but in fit. They used be baggier but now they hug my legs more, giving for a slimmer look.

The aggressive down turned shoe naturally creates tension that helps pull you towards the rock in addition to the tension generated by the foot. There is rubber over the toe that provides a lot of friction when a toe hook is required. Finally, the heel has a relatively thin ridge that runs down the middle which allows heel hooks to catch small bumps and edges to help lock the hook in. Everything about this shoe is designed to help pull you in towards the wall!I was initially put off by the Dragon\\'s laces as I\\'ve grown accustomed to the convenience of velcro straps. After some use, I\\'ve realized that laces aren\\'t a problem at all on the Dragons. The fitment is snug enough that I can keep the lower straps loose, slip the shoe one, and slightly cinch off the last set of laces to tie them off and never have issues with the shoe slipping a very quick affair. In the event the climb demands a huuuuuuuuuuge heel hook, I can take the time to cinch down all the laces.Most climbing shoes I typically size down a full size from my street size but with Dragons, a good place to start is your street size. For reference, I wear Five Ten\\'s Anasazi VCS in 9 which is a snug and comfortable fit. The same fit on the Dragons comes in size 10. I used to have a pair of dragons in size 9.5 and I discovered that they don\\'t stretch much (synthetic material). The fit was so tight, that I could only keep them on for one boulder attempt at a time which discouraged me from wearing them at all.\",\"title\":\"Almost feels like cheating\",\"username\":\"Joe\"},{\"date\":\"2014-03-24T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-02T02:42:53Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-02-06T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Five-Ten-Mens-Dragon-Climbing/dp/B008XESU3O\"],\"text\":\"Dragons are the best shoes I have owned.

I am still surprised sometimes when I stick to foot holds outside that I swear are no more than slight grooves.I would say DEFINITELY try these shoes on before purchasing, the heel cup can fit a little weird. I am a street 10 but I climb in 9.5s. I would personally prefer the heel cup to maybe be a little bit more snug, but if I downsize any more the toe box will be way too tight. That being said, if I actually tie my shoes, I don\\'t have a problem with my foot popping out of the shoe.I know that many climbers aren\\'t fond of this pair as a bouldering she because of the laces - having to untie and retie them between problems, but generally speaking I am able to climb pretty well in them without tying my shoe laces. I do keep the strings tight enough that it is not a problem, but at the same time it is loose enough that I am able to just slip my shoe on. Before climbing, I just pull and tighten the laces without actually tying them, and it hasn\\'t been a problem. The only time that I tie my shoe are on long sport routes or when I need a super strong heel.\",\"title\":\"but generally speaking I am able to climb pretty well in them without tying my shoe laces 2 of 2 people found this helpful.

The aggressive down turned shoe naturally creates tension that helps pull you towards the rock in addition to the tension generated by the foot. There is rubber over the toe that provides a lot of friction when a toe hook is required. Finally, the heel has a relatively thin ridge that runs down the middle which allows heel hooks to catch small bumps and edges to help lock the hook in. Everything about this shoe is designed to help pull you in towards the wall!I was initially put off by the Dragon\\'s laces as I\\'ve grown accustomed to the convenience of velcro straps. After some use, I\\'ve realized that laces aren\\'t a problem at all on the Dragons. The fitment is snug enough that I can keep the lower straps loose, slip the shoe one, and slightly cinch off the last set of laces to tie them off and never have issues with the shoe slipping a very quick affair. In the event the climb demands a huuuuuuuuuuge heel hook, I can take the time to cinch down all the laces.Most climbing shoes I typically size down a full size from my street size but with Dragons, a good place to start is your street size. For reference, I wear Five Ten\\'s Anasazi VCS in 9 which is a snug and comfortable fit. The same fit on the Dragons comes in size 10. I used to have a pair of dragons in size 9.5 and I discovered that they don\\'t stretch much (synthetic material). The fit was so tight, that I could only keep them on for one boulder attempt at a time which discouraged me from wearing them at all.\",\"title\":\"Almost feels like cheating 3 of 3 people found this helpful.

After climbing 2-3 times a week, every week, my shoes have finally developed a hole in the rand of the front toe box as of July 2014. That is 9 months of solid use. I was disappointed, but it was to be expected. I\\'ve only taken these shoes on 5 outdoors climbing sessions on granite and sandstone the rest of the time was at an indoor gym.Street size I\\'m normally a 9.5 or 10 depending on the brand. I got these shoes in a size 9.5 and found them to be very tight and a bit painful at first. However after a few months of climbing they stretched out to the point where I was able to wear them fairly comfortably 1-2 hours a time. This was a plus because I could wear them for longer periods with little pain, but it was also a minus because my toes would slide around a bit when I was doing difficult routes. As the months passed by, the more I wished I ordered these in a size 9 because my foot would slightly slide inside on difficult routes. (However, I have come to realize that I should have 2 climbing shoes. One for high performance and one for training/everyday. The size I chose is perfect for everyday. A full size down would be better for high performance for those difficult routes.)Like I said, at first they were very tight on me and obviously all the rubber was in new condition, so I was able to edge VERY WELL on small/slanted foot chips. But as time passed and my shoe became more stretched and the rubber wore out, I had a little more trouble sticking to the same foot chips. Resoling my shoes would help a lot with the rubber/sticky edging aspect.My largest complaint with the shoes is the heel. As I started climbing outdoors more and started doing higher difficulties, I realized how important heel hooks are.Read more\",\"title\":\"Nice shoes. I like em.

Functions are similar, so are my reviews. Expect to take a few days to really understand all the features. Easy to use once you are familiar. A few points to know. TEMP - You need to remove the watch for 10-15 minutes to get an accurate reading. COMPASS - Do the calibration. It\\'s easy and greatly improves results. ALT - Have a know reference altitude to set EACH time you need altitude. Simple adjustment with the pull-out crown. Altitude is effected by pressure and needs to set to a know altitude before setting out. I find it is +/- about 10 ft on average. BAROMETER - like ALT, needs to be set with a known pressure at a given location for accurate reading. Pressure readings are very accurate at the reference location from that point on. Pressure readings are unreliable if you are changing altitude. I have calibrated for my home and find readings nearly identical to an expensive digital recording barometer.Gulf Master adds a Moon Age and TIDE function which are useful, wish this watch had them.I am outside a lot, so no problems for me keeping the battery full. The radio time set function works well. I do need to set the watch near a window facing Colorado (east in my case) and slightly elevates off the counter for reliable time sets. The antenna is in the 12 o\\'clock end of the case. Point that end towards the window for best results. Default auto set time is midnight. Takes about 3 seconds to initiate a manual radio sync if needed.I also have the Casio G-Shock GWN1000-9A.

I have yet to experience a catastrophic drop to test the comp toe\\'s impact strength, but it feels very rigid and strong to the touch a.k.a. no obvious bending or flexibility.The upper material is a stiff and very solid-feeling leather with matte surface finish this is not a bright leather nor will it accept a polishing but I think it makes for a great durable look. Additionally the dull sandy finish helps to hide damage and wear small cuts and marks do not stand out against it. Around the cuff is a section of softer padded leather outer which (for the Dark Brown color variant) is darker, almost black, matching the bottom sole.The lacing hardware is all-metal and fully riveted on, something I have learned to look for as a mark of boot quality. It features 3 fixed and 3 open-hook lacing pairs for easy lacing and removal, which I much prefer to all-fixed lacings that require you to pull the laces at each crossing to tighten/loosen (and can be painful to remove on a hot day). My previous boots had the same configuration with plastic hardware these appear to be much more durable, at least visually.The interior shaping of these boots is somewhat unusual I find the toebox to be rather wide and tall compared to the fit elsewhere, likely an artifact of the large composite toepiece.Read more\",\"title\":\"Wolverine Men\\'s Cabor Waterproof 6-Inch Work Boot, Dark Brown\",\"username\":\"John\"},{\"dateAdded\":\"2015-11-07T10:27:11Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-12-13T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Mens-W10314-Cabor-Brown/dp/B00E4WDCKK\"],\"text\":\"I got these boots to replace my old Craftsman boots.

But I wore them all day the first day to see what the give was in the leather and now both feel fine. The arch support is quite prominent and takes a little getting used to in terms of foot tilt but body adjustment occurred in a very short while. Laces up fairly quickly and the smooth toe and lower section with no overlaying seams down the sides makes for a longer lasting boot design, IMO. Previous Wolverine designs I have had have lost stitching in those very seams due to foot flexing and became relatively useless after a year and a half or so. Still, they were very comfortable so I stuck with the Brand. The Falcon shoe does have the semi oxford side seam so I will not be doing much in the way of hard work with them.

Great non slip soles.Cons-The leather on the toe got cut and scratched really easily in only a couple weeks detracting from the appearance, the lace hooks at the top would have been better if they were riveted on eyelets like the rest of the boot or regular eyelets. The hooks catch on pants and other things at work and are a hazard at times.Note I took these hiking one time to see how these would do.

In the KSO Evo they kept the light and thin structure that drew me to the EL-X, but corrected the weird heel and added a lace system that allows you to adjust the fit but still not have to tie it every time you put them on (set it once in the beginning and it should be good to go).Read more\",\"title\":\"Best all-around Vibram so far 65 of 69 people found this helpful.

Totally different with less shoe and introduction of the Nike Air Zoom technology.First off the construction of the shoe is excellent. Fused overlays (much lighter) with no stitching makes it much lighter and better looking. The upper on the forefoot has a very stretchy mesh much like the Nike Flyknit that makes the toebox fit snuggly, but still stretches where toes are not cramped. Midfoot upper has a very supportive but not stiff overlay that just hugs the foot. Heel upper has a very firm heel cup that is very supportive.The cushioning of the Pegasus 31 is much different than on previous models. They lessened the amount of cushioning and added the Air Zoom cushioning on the heel strike. This makes the shoe very responsive without feeling too squishy or mushy but that is very subjective. Also, heel to toe drop is much less than previous models at 10mm which is better. The footprint of the sole is wide which is great because you feel very solid when you strike the ground. Some shoe manufacturers make the footprint of the sole is much too narrow and it feels too easy to roll an ankle and just not solid on the strike. The shoe is lower to the ground, however, provides ample cushioning. The shoe feels pretty light. The shoe looks really good and gets the much improved award for appearance from the Pegasus 30 models.This is like the Swiss Army knife of running shoes. It has plenty of cushioning for long runs, yet the design also allows them to be still good for speed work. The shoe is designed more for slight overpronators as the heel cushioning is slightly firmer on the inside of the heel as opposed to softer on outside of the heel. They are great to run in and you forget them very quickly.Read more\",\"title\":\"The Best Nike Pegasus Yet. Best running shoe I have used in a long time.\",\"username\":\"Benjamin K.

Up until this shoe, I found them to be a reliable and consistent fit. These fit smaller, so I had to go up half a size from what I have been wearing for ages. One other difference I have found is that the heal lifts a bit on the outside when compared to previous Pegasus. This was a spot that wore more on my previous shoes, so I am interested in seeing how this impacts the wear pattern long-term. Overall, the new Pegasus feels very comfortable, reactive, and is far lighter than previous versions with only a minimal reduction in cushioning.

The updated versions are probably more stylish and supportive than the original ones, and the eyelets are reinforced, but I liked the original versions better because they were more flexible than the updated ones. The updated versions are slightly larger than the same size of the original versions, so for my 7th pair I will be ordering a half size smaller. I did try other shoes to see if they might have the same combination of lightness, flexibility and comfort as the original version of this shoe, but to no avail.

If you are simply looking for Jazz shoes in any generic dance situation you cannot go wrong.Personally, I use these shoes for my swing dance lessons and eventually turned them into my actual dance shoes out at clubs. They are as the product details describes and it came new, unlike some other online shoes I have bought. I have had them for about 10 weeks now, using them about 2.5 hours a week. They are holding up well, no tears or weak points. The only difference between them now and when the came out of the box is they have molded themselves to my feet and there is some crinkling in the leather where I pull the shoelaces tight (this is to be expected).I can assure anyone who is looking for spectator swing shoes for dancing, it will be hard to go wrong here. If you were intending to use them as dress or for style shoes, I do not recommend it. Although they do look nice, its not their purpose and you would wear them out much faster (suede bottoms and all).\",\"title\":\"Good price for good shoes 6 of 6 people found this helpful.

I\\'ve used Chaco sandals during that time as a Peace Corps volunteer in Africa, on my feet in some incredibly remote and rugged terrain. I\\'ve used Chacos sandals as a surf photographer in Costa Rica where they were constantly soaked with salt water and buried in sand. I\\'m wearing a pair, right now as I type this, that I\\'ve had since 2006, and am about to re-glue to soles to the tread. I think it\\'s safe to say that I know Chaco footwear, and I\\'ve liked them more than any other sandal and shoe brand, ever. When it comes to the Outcross Lace Water Shoe, Chaco has disappointed me. Don\\'t get me wrong, they\\'re solidly constructed, the Vibram outsole is sticky, and so far the upper and the lower part of the shoe has stood up to everything a National Park Ranger working in South West Utah can throw at them (wearing a bullet-proof vest, full duty gear, etc.). Yet, the lacing system has me confused. There are so many other brands of shoes and sandals out there using a lacing system that works, and Chaco tried to re-invent the wheel for some reason the way they\\'ve designed theirs. I had my Outcross Lace Water Shoes for two weeks, wore them maybe 10 times, and the plastic cinch for the quick laces broke. The way they\\'re designed, when you pull up on the laces to cinch them tight, it stresses the plastic cinch and bends and breaks it, releasing it from the strangely large amount of fabric that keeps it attached to the tongue of the shoe. This means that the tongue of the shoes falls below the lace, and the lace is now up against your foot, chafing terribly if not noticed and corrected consistently.Read more\",\"title\":\"Awesome shoe, but the lacing system is awful.\",\"username\":\"stmccaffrey\"},{\"date\":\"2014-09-16T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-01T04:03:10Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-12-15T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Chaco-Mens-Outcross-Water-Gunmetal/dp/B00E41Z5GK\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Chaco-Outcross-Water-Chocolate-Brown/dp/B00E41YMZK\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Chaco-Mens-Outcross-Water-Gunmetal/dp/B00E41YYTY\"],\"text\":\"good.

I\\'m wearing a pair, right now as I type this, that I\\'ve had since 2006, and am about to re-glue to soles to the tread. I think it\\'s safe to say that I know Chaco footwear, and I\\'ve liked them more than any other sandal and shoe brand, ever. When it comes to the Outcross Lace Water Shoe, Chaco has disappointed me. Don\\'t get me wrong, they\\'re solidly constructed, the Vibram outsole is sticky, and so far the upper and the lower part of the shoe has stood up to everything a National Park Ranger working in South West Utah can throw at them (wearing a bullet-proof vest, full duty gear, etc.). Yet, the lacing system has me confused. There are so many other brands of shoes and sandals out there using a lacing system that works, and Chaco tried to re-invent the wheel for some reason the way they\\'ve designed theirs. I had my Outcross Lace Water Shoes for two weeks, wore them maybe 10 times, and the plastic cinch for the quick laces broke. The way they\\'re designed, when you pull up on the laces to cinch them tight, it stresses the plastic cinch and bends and breaks it, releasing it from the strangely large amount of fabric that keeps it attached to the tongue of the shoe. This means that the tongue of the shoes falls below the lace, and the lace is now up against your foot, chafing terribly if not noticed and corrected consistently.Read more\",\"title\":\"Awesome shoe, but the lacing system is awful. 3 of 3 people found this helpful.

Not a purse, mind you, something masculine looking to me.I very much like this bag. You can spend hundreds on a leather briefcase. I found a few over a thousand. This cost me about 95. The leather is pretty good. The finish and shine are nice. The color is gorgeous. It holds my Mac book Air (11 inch) with room to spare and a few files of roughly an inch each easily. It has one main zippered compartment. Each side then has a smaller zippered compartment. These smaller compartments can hold a few items up to 6.5 inches high and 11 inches wide, though such an item can\\'t be very think. I have my wallet and a change purse in one smaller pocket. Inside the main compartment is an even smaller zippered compartment roughly 8.5 inches wide and 4.75 inches deep. Also there are two top-open pockets in the main compartment on the other side. They are not very big nor terribly sturdy. They would hold a small wallet, cell phone, gum, or such. But that would probably fall out with use for me as they are open at the top. Oh, there is another zippered pocket on what I guess is the front. It is nearly as big as the other two, smaller zippered pockets, though a little less wide.Honestly, I have long wanted a smaller, leather briefcase that zips closed at the top and opens at the top without a flap over the top. I tend to fill my brief case, and they get heavy. The flap-over models cause me problems with the clasps, etc. and require extra room to open (think small airplane seats or when you are stressed out and being questioned on the witness stand...it happens...). This does that perfectly. It is soft-sided and won\\'t stand up on it\\'s own, but I don\\'t mind that.Read more\",\"title\":\"Love the briefcase!\",\"username\":\"Jim\"}]',\n",

I\\'ll post some pictures for reference. It seems to make them come out easier too.

Fits perfectly on my 2 beltUDPATE: So after some use I have more to add, There should be velcro on the back to hold it to the duty belt (I have velcro on the inside of my belt) which would help to better hold it in place. It has a tendency to slide around right now. I did add my own velcro to help hold it which is working good. I said above that they fit to tight, well i sat down and tried to figure out the best way. If you have one swing arm facing one way and the other the opposite way they seen to fit better. It also helps to try and slide on cuff in a little way before you start the other one. I\\'ll post some pictures for reference. It seems to make them come out easier too. If you put them in facing the same way its almost to tight and has a tendency to racket themselves further closed, causing the end of the swing arm to start poking out, causing them to get stuck and held up upon removal.\",\"title\":\"Not bad - tight hold 10 of 12 people found this helpful.

I am an extreme supinator who prefers a neutral shoe with lots of cushioning throughout. I can\\'t wear any shoe with a dual density sole or motion control. I can tell in short order if I\\'m wearing the wrong shoe, as my arches will flare up during a walk/run. Generally, with Nike, one must buy a half size larger this has been my experience, anyway. The Pegasus 30 is true to my normal size (11). The full-length Cushlon is top-shelf and it provides plush cushioning throughout the stride. The upper is breathable and seamless, so there are no painful spots on the top of the foot (or anywhere else). The shoe provides a snug and supportive fit and is light in weight. There is plenty of room in the toe box area, so no pinching. The sole provides excellent grip and contact with paved surfaces. Although I haven\\'t run in wet conditions in this shoe, I am certain that the traction would be excellent. Now, I will provide a short list of other shoes that I have worn/run in for extended periods that I feel the Pegasus is superior to: Asics Kayano 19, Asics Nimbus 14, Brooks Ghost 5, New Balance 990. Of course this is based on my subjectivity, but the Pegasus feels lighter and provides more plush cushioning than any of these shoes. I will also mention that this is my first pair of Pegasus. If Nike continues to be consistent with future designs on this shoe, I can\\'t see myself wearing anything else.

Solid, dependable, it\\'s been around forever. It just goes to show that the best running shoe is the shoe that fits YOU best. Recently I splurged on a pair of Nike fly-knits. It gets great reviews and it fit me really nicely at first, but after running more than 4 miles in them my ankle started hurting. I no doubt believe that those who are giving the fly-knit 5 stars are having a great experience. I have learned, and re-learned, though, that for me, nothing beats the Pegasus. It\\'s not a minimalist shoe but it is so soft and has so much padding that I can run forever in these and never feel the pounding. Yes the fly-knit is light as a feather, but I will trade off a little extra weight for a shoe that I can feel and that gives my feet the protection they need. The Nike Vomero is a similar shoe and I recently trained and ran a 1/2 marathon in the Vomero without issues. However, the Pegasus is even more comfortable than the Vomero for me and it is less expensive. I caught a great deal on amazon and got these for 83.49! I have never been disappointed in the Nike Pegasus- why I waste my money trying the latest craze in running shoe\\'s I don\\'t know. It will be Pegasus forever from now on. I don\\'t know if it\\'s because my meet are a little flat, but I find myself buying the Pegasus and Vomero\\'s a full size and a half larger than my normal shoes and they are very comfortable for me. I know the rule of thumb for running shoes is a 1/2 size bigger only, but you should definitely try these on at a local store and try a few sizes larger before purchasing.\",\"title\":\"Pegasus forever- I will never stray again\",\"username\":\"jim hoppe\"},{\"date\":\"2013-08-07T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-02T02:26:10Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-12-12T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Pegasus-Running-Shoes-Cobalt/dp/B005ZOZ9PC\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Pegasus-Mens-Running-Shoes/dp/B00KB6LZES\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Pegasus-Running-Blue-Volt-White-599205/dp/B005ZOZ7WM\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Pegasus-Running-Shoes-10-5%60/dp/B013VLBRV0\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Pegasus-Running-Shoes-Black-Blue-10-5/dp/B005ZOZ8HQ\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Pegasus-4E-Armry-Running/dp/B00AMTMO4O\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Pegasus-Running-Shoes-Black-Blue-12/dp/B0156YIOF2\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Pegasus-Challenge-Black-Running/dp/B00BLQ7BJK\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Nike-Pegasus-4E-Armry-Running/dp/B00AMTML2E\"],\"text\":\"Great shoe.

Solid, dependable, it\\'s been around forever. It just goes to show that the best running shoe is the shoe that fits YOU best. Recently I splurged on a pair of Nike fly-knits. It gets great reviews and it fit me really nicely at first, but after running more than 4 miles in them my ankle started hurting. I no doubt believe that those who are giving the fly-knit 5 stars are having a great experience. I have learned, and re-learned, though, that for me, nothing beats the Pegasus. It\\'s not a minimalist shoe but it is so soft and has so much padding that I can run forever in these and never feel the pounding. Yes the fly-knit is light as a feather, but I will trade off a little extra weight for a shoe that I can feel and that gives my feet the protection they need. The Nike Vomero is a similar shoe and I recently trained and ran a 1/2 marathon in the Vomero without issues. However, the Pegasus is even more comfortable than the Vomero for me and it is less expensive. I caught a great deal on amazon and got these for 83.49! I have never been disappointed in the Nike Pegasus- why I waste my money trying the latest craze in running shoe\\'s I don\\'t know. It will be Pegasus forever from now on. I don\\'t know if it\\'s because my meet are a little flat, but I find myself buying the Pegasus and Vomero\\'s a full size and a half larger than my normal shoes and they are very comfortable for me. I know the rule of thumb for running shoes is a 1/2 size bigger only, but you should definitely try these on at a local store and try a few sizes larger before purchasing.\",\"title\":\"Pegasus forever- I will never stray again 12 of 14 people found this helpful.

I am an extreme supinator who prefers a neutral shoe with lots of cushioning throughout. I can\\'t wear any shoe with a dual density sole or motion control. I can tell in short order if I\\'m wearing the wrong shoe, as my arches will flare up during a walk/run. Generally, with Nike, one must buy a half size larger this has been my experience, anyway. The Pegasus 30 is true to my normal size (11). The full-length Cushlon is top-shelf and it provides plush cushioning throughout the stride. The upper is breathable and seamless, so there are no painful spots on the top of the foot (or anywhere else). The shoe provides a snug and supportive fit and is light in weight. There is plenty of room in the toe box area, so no pinching. The sole provides excellent grip and contact with paved surfaces. Although I haven\\'t run in wet conditions in this shoe, I am certain that the traction would be excellent. Now, I will provide a short list of other shoes that I have worn/run in for extended periods that I feel the Pegasus is superior to: Asics Kayano 19, Asics Nimbus 14, Brooks Ghost 5, New Balance 990. Of course this is based on my subjectivity, but the Pegasus feels lighter and provides more plush cushioning than any of these shoes. I will also mention that this is my first pair of Pegasus. If Nike continues to be consistent with future designs on this shoe, I can\\'t see myself wearing anything else.

I doubt if I\\'ll use the chronograph (timer) functions very much, but it\\'s nice to have them just in case. Plus, the extra dials and buttons give the watch a military / techy look, which I like. NOTE: the second hand on the watch is not the large one shown in the 12:00 position in the image that hand is used for the chronometer function. The second hand that turns all the time is the little one in the small dial at the bottom of the watch. This wasn\\'t an issue for me, but I thought I\\'d mention it since some people might not have read the previous review where that was discussed. One aspect of this watch that I much prefer over some of the other black ion watches is that the finish of the band is glossy, but not super shiny. (I saw some other model Seiko chronographs at Kohl\\'s the other night in the display case their finishes appeared almost like a shiny black glass mirror or black chrome a look that was a bit over the top for me.) By the way, there is also just the tiniest hint of a brown or copper tint in the band. Not a lot- the band still looks black, but not jet black, and not a gun metal bluish black. As an aside, when I took it to the jewelry store to have a couple of links taken out of the band, the lady who waited on me asked if it was a titanium watch, so it definitely does not come across as a cheap watch even though the price is quite reasonable.

I read and heard from other climbers that fiveten\\'s rubber was the stickiest so I decided to go with this brand. I looked at some beginner geared models but then saw this for only 70 and decided to get it.Now for the actual product-I ordered them in my street shoe size after reading a bunch of reviews, and if I could go back I would only go a half size smaller. They were nice and tight but comfy enough to walk in when I first got them, and after about 10 climbing sessions they fit my feet better but haven\\'t stretched at all. The only reason I would want them smaller is because there\\'s a little gap between my heel and the back of the shoe so when attempting extreme heel hooks they tend to slip off (they\\'re fine for any heel hooks involving less than like 60 of your body weight). As far as the stretching thing goes-some people on here say they stretch a ton and you should order two sizes small and all that. Well, clearly if you get small ones and force your feet into them they\\'ll stretch to your foot, but if you order them too big they won\\'t really stretch much because your feet aren\\'t putting as much pressure on them. The only way these would ever stretch out by 2 sizes is if you bought them two sizes small, but this would just be causing yourself pain for no reason. So my advice would be go a half size down or full size at most if you want them super tight, they\\'re not going to magically stretch and become bigger than your foot. But if you want a super aggressive tight shoe for crazy inverted bouldering with intense heel hooking these aren\\'t really what you want anyway. So as far as performance goes, these are great. The rubber is very sticky, and I can feel the rock extremely well in these.Read more\",\"title\":\"Awesome shoe 4 of 4 people found this helpful.

I had been climbing 3-4 times a week indoor with them just as a training shoe and I can honestly say that it\\'s an amazing all around shoe. If you\\'re just getting into the sport, I\\'d say this is the shoe for you. The rubber on the Mocs is killer, smears like a champ, you can feel where you\\'re stepping through the rubber but it still gives you that support. Even if your foot work isn\\'t that great the rubber lasts. I\\'ve had them for 6 months and they are still awesome. The break in period isn\\'t bad at all, after day 3 they fit like a glove. Super comfortable. I used these to climb V0 - V5 / 5.9 - 5.12. Although I will admit it\\'s kinda hard doing harder climbs in these shoes, only because they aren\\'t as aggressive as other shoes like Dragons, or Hi-angles. (I only wear five ten, the rubber is too good) honestly there is only one down side about these shoes, and that is how much they stretch. Im still giving this shoe a 5 star rating because it was my fault that I didn\\'t size down. I got them in my street size which is 10.5, but they stretched maybe a whole size up. So I shoulda bought them in a 9.5. IMPORTANT: You will hear people say that you shouldn\\'t size down in these because they are too painful, do not listen to them. Climbing shoes are supposed to be tight, not snug tight. Yes they hurt. If they don\\'t hurt when you first get them, then they are too big. To beginners that want to ease their way into climbing shoes, don\\'t go a full size down (unless you really wanna be hardcore) just go a half size down, because the stretching actually really does effect performance. Not that much, only when you\\'re trying to do a heel hook or toe hook. They also turn your feet red from the dye inside the shoe, im indifferent about that haha hope this helped, happy climbing!\",\"title\":\"If you need help read this!\",\"username\":\"Kindle Customer\"},{\"date\":\"2015-08-04T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-02T00:52:54Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-12-19T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Five-Ten-Anasazi-Moccasym-Climbing/dp/B008XEVBXA\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Five-Ten-Anasazi-Moccasym-Climbing/dp/B008XEVBTY\"],\"text\":\"This is the shoe to get once you\\'ve blown out that first pair of Mad Rocks/Defy\\'s/Rogues.

It became clear at that point I had skipped a crucial step in my development as a climber.Some notes:-If you\\'re careful about foot placement, these will put in work. My current pair has been going strong for 18 months. The edge is, of course, gone, but what you get during the later phase of the Mocc\\'s life cycle is improved sensitivity and enhanced smearing. This is important for beginner to intermediate climbers. What I discovered is that the Mocc, being a more sensitive shoe, trained my foot placement and ultimately made my feet stronger on more difficult footholds. A much stiffer shoe (indeed, certain aggressive shoes) will inhibit sensitivity, and, in many cases, encourage bad footwork.-As far as form-factor is concerned, you couldn\\'t find a less fussy shoe. There aren\\'t any gimmicks here. The C4 rubber is sticky and pliable, and is just thick enough to give you a good balance of support and sensitivity during the break-in period.-Fit is crucial. If this is your next shoe after ditching your starters, don\\'t be afraid to size down to something that is effectively uncomfortable. These will stretch, and stretch significantly. I wear between a 9 1/2 and a 9 in street shoes, and a 7 1/2 was a good (initially) uncomfortable fit.Read more\",\"title\":\"It will do everything better than your starter shoe\",\"username\":\"Josh Hallett\"},{\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-02T00:52:54Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Five-Ten-Anasazi-Moccasym-Climbing/dp/B008XEVE28\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Five-Ten-Anasazi-Moccasym-Climbing/dp/B008XEVBXA\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Five-Ten-Anasazi-Moccasym-Climbing/dp/B008XEVBTY\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Five-Ten-Anasazi-Moccasym-Climbing/dp/B008XEVE4Q\"],\"text\":\"These are my go-to shoe for crack climbing, whether on Yosemite granite or Indian Creek sandstone.

I read and heard from other climbers that fiveten\\'s rubber was the stickiest so I decided to go with this brand. I looked at some beginner geared models but then saw this for only 70 and decided to get it.Now for the actual product-I ordered them in my street shoe size after reading a bunch of reviews, and if I could go back I would only go a half size smaller. They were nice and tight but comfy enough to walk in when I first got them, and after about 10 climbing sessions they fit my feet better but haven\\'t stretched at all. The only reason I would want them smaller is because there\\'s a little gap between my heel and the back of the shoe so when attempting extreme heel hooks they tend to slip off (they\\'re fine for any heel hooks involving less than like 60 of your body weight). As far as the stretching thing goes-some people on here say they stretch a ton and you should order two sizes small and all that. Well, clearly if you get small ones and force your feet into them they\\'ll stretch to your foot, but if you order them too big they won\\'t really stretch much because your feet aren\\'t putting as much pressure on them. The only way these would ever stretch out by 2 sizes is if you bought them two sizes small, but this would just be causing yourself pain for no reason. So my advice would be go a half size down or full size at most if you want them super tight, they\\'re not going to magically stretch and become bigger than your foot. But if you want a super aggressive tight shoe for crazy inverted bouldering with intense heel hooking these aren\\'t really what you want anyway. So as far as performance goes, these are great. The rubber is very sticky, and I can feel the rock extremely well in these.Read more\",\"title\":\"Awesome shoe\",\"username\":\"RCf\"},{\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-02T00:52:54Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2016-02-06T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Five-Ten-Anasazi-Moccasym-Climbing/dp/B008XEVE2I\"],\"text\":\"These are my go-to shoe for crack climbing, whether on Yosemite granite or Indian Creek sandstone.

I guess the skin will get used to it.2. The color in the center of the links is black, not dark gray like in the photo, and unless you are in bright daylight, the watch looks black. Fine for some, but if you are looking for a gray/dark gray watch, this is not it. It\\'s way darker in real life than in the picture.3. The second hand that goes around the dial like in other watches is instead a stopwatch, so it just sits there at the 12 o\\'clock position, while the actual second hand is the tiny dial on the left at the 9 o\\'clock position. I would have liked if it would function instead as a stopwatch when needed, and as a second hand the rest of the time as it just sits there taking up space and looks a bit weird - exactly as it is in the picture.4.

It\\'s even a little lighter than my Seiko watches that are smaller. It doesn\\'t feel cheap at all and the whole watch feels pretty solid in hand. If you prefer lighter watches on your wrist this would be a nice choice.The design of the watch is superb for the price range which makes up for the lack of features. My only complaint is that the watch face of the Navy Blue I bought looks a lot darker than what it shows on pictures. It\\'s partially because the face is recessed into the watch and light doesn\\'t enter from the side, where as in the picture shown shows you what it looks like under very soft light. The color is accurate but for the most part the watch doesn\\'t look like that in reality.One final note - the picture shown on amazon doesn\\'t show you the knob. It\\'s actually got the Nixon logo in silver on red (same as the color of the hands) , which I find to be a nice accent to the watch itself.Overall it\\'s a very good buy and shipping was very quick.

I ended up wearing them more than expected and thus had to replace them a lot sooner than what is the norm for me. The reason I wore them so much is due to the styling. In other words, they go well with a pair of jeans and even in business casual attire.Although the shoes are a bit pricey in comparison to other casual shoes on the market, the Geox has a few features which justify the cost for me. First, is the styling which - as mentioned above - allows me to wear them most anytime. Second is that they are really comfortable. The first pair I obtained were a wide size and fit quite well. For my second pair, I was not able to locate a wide size and so I opted to buy a shoe that was a half size bigger. So far, so good in this regard.The other thing about these shoes is that do a good job of repelling foot odor. Evidently this is a patented feature of Geox shoes and, I must say, that my shoes never really failed me in this regard. And, I must admit that my feet can get a bit sweaty after a day of walking around in warm tempratures.Needless to say, the fact that I bought a second pair is indication in and of itself that I am happy with the shoes. If I had a complaint, it is in the fact that these shoes are hard to find. I actually searched for quite a while to find this shoe in the right color and in a size that I felt I could live with. I hope the search will be easier when it comes time to buy the next pair.\",\"title\":\"Great shoe for different situations\",\"username\":\"Christopher J.\"},{\"dateAdded\":\"2015-09-20T20:42:28Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-09-19T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Geox-Fast11-Driving-Moccasin-Coffee/dp/B005BSRACC\"],\"text\":\"Very comfortable, very predictable fit.

From looks to function, it does not disappoint. This watch seems to be very well made with close attention paid to detail. There are no blemishes or misalignment of the watch itself or the bracelet. The finish is high quality bright and shiny for the gloss sections and with an even luster of the brushed stainless steel parts. I had to remove some bracelet links with the Citizen split pin tool that came with the promotion Amazon was running. This was not hard to do but required very careful attention and good close-up eyesight.The watch seemed to be running as soon as I took it out of it\\'s cylindrical box. I thought that was odd until I read that as soon as the watch is exposed to light, it starts. I left it on the window ledge of my home the first day in bright sunshine and it has kept running since. Setting the time, day and date was rather easy after following the instructions. So far, after almost 1 month, my watch has lost about 1 second compared to the analog atomic clock in my home - not to shabby to say the least!!This watch is also a bit smaller in diameter than many contemporary watches at 36mm. I am grateful for this because I have a thin wrist. I wanted a new watch that would not look like a pocket watch strapped to my wrist (and indeed, some watches today are the diameter of old pocket watches!). Furthermore, it fits easily under the cuff of my shirt whereas I am not sure that a large diameter thick watch could.All in all, I have a well made, solar powered, highly accurate watch that looks good in practically any setting.

My husband liked the fact that the hands illuminate so he was able to tell time at night as well.As for the ongoing debate on whether the face is black or gray, I think it\\'s safe to say it\\'s more black than gray. By that I mean I see why some people see gray while others see black. As an amateur photographer, true black really makes other colors stand out because all the colors seem sharper and richer. IMHO, and on a blackness scale of 1-10, I would rate the blackness a 9. I think the face on this watch isn\\'t a 10 due in part to the fine rings engraved on the face, which causes a glare/reflection.

I own other London Fog coats and jackets so I knew the quality would be there without question. And, it is. Being able to purchase it at a great discount on amazon (with quick delivery, I might add) was a great plus.There are four exterior pockets, one on top of the other on each side. The top pockets are zippered, which is a very nice feature, as I seem to use them a lot. No more having smaller items fall out. There are three interior pockets. Two are actually pretty spacious and are top open access, one left and one right, and secured with velco. The final, lower left side, has a flap, again with Velcro. And there have been times I have used all of them.The material is soft and feels good when wearing. The adjustable snap cuff is an added bonus. The jacket is well-made with good London Fog attention to detail. Two snaps on the sleeve to fit probably any size arm. Sometimes, I even unsnap them, depends on the look I want. As of this writing, my jacket looks exactly as pictured on amazon.Make no mistake. This is not for extreme winter wear. I bought it for spring and fall use, as well as the occasional crisp summer nights. It is perfect for that use. It has even kept me very dry in rain, including some pretty heavy downpours. The microfiber dries out fairly quickly. I have not had any issues with wrinkling.I am quite pleased with, and highly recommend, this jacket.

I also didn\\'t expect it to be quite as heavy a material as it is. Most golf jackets are quite lightweight, not too much heavier than a windbreaker. This is noticeably heavier and thicker than any golf jacket I\\'ve ever owned. It all adds up to a return shipment to Amazon, in my case.It\\'s not my intention to dump on this jacket, by any means.

The width probably makes the sandal look a little bulky, but that does not diminish the comfort. The sole is firm with good internal cushioning. At first the sole is a little slick on carpeted surfaces and some other inside flooring. This disappears pretty quickly. No problems outside on concrete, grass, or gravel.

The thickness of this robe is perfect for me thick, but not so thick that it is hard to move around in, and is very absorbent for after a shower.The robe launders well, and when washed according to instructions (cold water, low heat drying) does not shrink a great deal. It is not fuzzy or linty and does not pill.Thank goodness it is not of the one size fits all sizing, and bearing in mind that this robe is unisex, the sizing seems true. If you are tall and are looking for an ankle length, this may not be the robe for you. I am nearly 5\\'8, and after laundering the robe is about an inch above my ankle. The sleeves are quite long and can be cuffed.A couple of complaints: I ordered the Marine color, expecting a medium blue as pictured. Marine is Navy. I like navy blue, so it\\'s no big deal for me, but it\\'s not the pretty blue of the picture.More of a complaint is the shape of the hood. It seems to have been made for a conehead!

The construction is fairly sturdy, and it\\'s big enough for my pregnant wife to cover herself AND the belly. The belt has lots of length to it, and the hood is very generous. It dries her off fast, and keeps her warm in the process. The thickness is just right, as anything thicker would weight too much and probably not breathe at all. For height/length reference, she\\'s 5\\'5 and slim, and the robe comes to about 2 above her ankles hanging open(without being draped over the baby belly!).Cons: It was VERY scratchy and stiff at first, even after a couple of washings. Now that she\\'s worn it in a bit, it\\'s starting to soften up. Also, the hanging tab inside the neck seam isn\\'t nearly sturdy enough to actually support the weight of the robe. Finally, the seams around the bottom edge were a bit loose, and we had to trim many, many unravelling threads and re-secure the seam ourselves.Overall:Not bad at all for the price. I\\'ve gone through quite a few \\'luxury\\' robes, looking for one that would be A) Ankle Length, B) Thick, but still absorbent, and C) Comfortable and roomy. This is the best so far, and quite a bit cheaper than the fancy robes you can buy at nice boutiques and spas.

The hood on this robe is outstanding! It\\'s large without being overly large. The brim of the hood comes down over my face to the very tip of my nose (if I pull it down). The cut of the hood material is nice and rounded so that you don\\'t have a cone head. When I pull the hood all the way forward the thickness of the material allows me to form the hood ever so slightly - if I want to see directly forward without looking down I pinch the brim and the hood stays up and out of the way (unlike those thin one-size-fits-all robes). Perfect.As I mentioned I have long arms.Read more\",\"title\":\"Bury me in this.\",\"username\":\"corran63horn\"}]',\n",
