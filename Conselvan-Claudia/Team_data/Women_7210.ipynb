If you kind of fall between sizes, like I do (between a 7 and 7.5), I might suggest going with the larger size.My main reason for this review is to discuss the packaging, which concerned me at first. The shoes arrived in a plain white box within the Amazon box with a cut-out of the original Nike box next to the shoes. The shoes themselves weren\\'t stuffed with paper as new shoes always are. Concerned that these were not new as advertised or, worse, they were knockoffs, I contacted the seller. The owner of Plug Nickel Traders, Doug, responded within a few hours and explained that they receive the shoes on pallets, which sometimes results in the original brand boxes becoming damaged. So, to protect the shoes, they re-package them in sturdy white boxes with the original box cutout included to prove authenticity. He was very professional (even in response to my somewhat snarky email!) and that explanation makes sense to me. Apparently, repackaging is common when the original packaging becomes damaged while in shipment to the vendor and is allowable by Amazon.Having said all that, the proof is in the pudding. The quality and comfort of these shoes leave me no doubt these are brand new and authentic Nike.

I have owned and out-mileaged 4 pair of Wave Riders including the 14, 15 and am now my third pair of 16\\'s. There are so many new features in the 17 it feels like a totally different shoe. Some reviewers I read noted it being a soft shoe, I found the opposite actually, and where the previous models felt like they were hugging my foot and cushioned all around, I felt as if the shoe was flat and the only cushion was limited and directly under my foot. I didn\\'t feel the stability of the 16 (though it is a neutral stability - I feel my foot is supported well in the previous models). In the 17 my foot actually felt lost in the shoe and gave more of the feeling of running on a hard, flat surface - no bounce, no spring and no support. There is less cloth on the upper and the shoe just didn\\'t feel stable on my foot. There is less padding around the ankle - which many say is an improvement, I am neutral on that point.Finally, there is a very visible change in the curvature of the shoe. Previous models of the Wave Rider had a noted rise in the toe of the shoe. With the new model, the entire sole of the shoe is flat. This is a significant change in the Wave Rider model.Overall, I had high hopes for the Wave Rider 17, but am very disheartened. The moment I placed the shoe on my foot I felt the significant change, running in them confirmed it. The comfort, stability (albeit minimal) and roll of the shoe is gone. It is a totally different shoe, quite comparable to the Sayonara which I have also run in. I really have nothing good to say about the 17, except that its release has lowered the price of the previous model, which I will be stocking up on - no intention to purchase this new model.\",\"title\":\"Total Makeover - No Similarities to 16\",\"username\":\"Laurel E.

I went to a great running store (Brooklyn Running Co. in NYC) where the guy spent a ton of time fitting me, and ended up with these puppies.Yes, the Mizuno Wave Rider 17 is apparently very different from the old versions. But most of the bad reviews seem to be coming from previous Wave Rider owners! If you are coming into this new shoe/brand looking for something with enough support for longer distances that won\\'t drag you down when you get to the last few miles, these shoes are great. I successfully ran that first half-marathon yesterday in them, with a time I don\\'t think I could have gotten wearing heavier shoes.The only thing I think could be better is that the fore-foot could use the slightest bit more cushioning. Literally, even just a half a centimeter, or a couple millimeters! I tend to land more mid-foot, and it\\'d be nice to have that fore-foot support for push-off. But honestly, after running 13.1 miles, I hardly even noticed it. I sure am sore from the distance, but my feet feel great -- no blisters or black toes here!Anyway, I never write reviews, but I thought I would write this one in case anyone else (like myself) got nervous reading the crazy amount of negative reviews. It seems to me this just isn\\'t the shoe for past-Wave Rider users. But it could be the shoe for a whole new fan base.If you can, try these on in a running store before ordering online. It really is the best way to see if a running shoe is right for you.(Also posted on Mizuno\\'s webpage for this shoe.)\",\"title\":\"Great supportive, yet lightweight, shoe 1 of 1 people found this helpful.

I have owned and out-mileaged 4 pair of Wave Riders including the 14, 15 and am now my third pair of 16\\'s. There are so many new features in the 17 it feels like a totally different shoe. Some reviewers I read noted it being a soft shoe, I found the opposite actually, and where the previous models felt like they were hugging my foot and cushioned all around, I felt as if the shoe was flat and the only cushion was limited and directly under my foot. I didn\\'t feel the stability of the 16 (though it is a neutral stability - I feel my foot is supported well in the previous models). In the 17 my foot actually felt lost in the shoe and gave more of the feeling of running on a hard, flat surface - no bounce, no spring and no support. There is less cloth on the upper and the shoe just didn\\'t feel stable on my foot. There is less padding around the ankle - which many say is an improvement, I am neutral on that point.Finally, there is a very visible change in the curvature of the shoe. Previous models of the Wave Rider had a noted rise in the toe of the shoe. With the new model, the entire sole of the shoe is flat. This is a significant change in the Wave Rider model.Overall, I had high hopes for the Wave Rider 17, but am very disheartened. The moment I placed the shoe on my foot I felt the significant change, running in them confirmed it. The comfort, stability (albeit minimal) and roll of the shoe is gone. It is a totally different shoe, quite comparable to the Sayonara which I have also run in. I really have nothing good to say about the 17, except that its release has lowered the price of the previous model, which I will be stocking up on - no intention to purchase this new model.\",\"title\":\"Total Makeover - No Similarities to 16 67 of 70 people found this helpful.

I tried getting in touch with Hunter, however I was told that the boots are not covered by the warranty, because the boots are foldable. I was essentially told that because the material is thin and the boot is foldable, the boot is more susceptible to tearing and it is unlikely that the boots will not be replaced. I have only worn these boots a handful of times (since its summer in Chicago) and found that these boots are not durable. They scuff easily, making the boots more likely to tear at the seams. I am overall very disappointed in the product, but more so in Hunter\\'s inability to accommodate their customers needs.

I love Naot brand shoes the Matai is a sure winner and I have purchased more than one pair in that style. I decided to go to my local store that sells Naot and try on other styles. I tried the Rongo (that I am reviewing here) and was immediately in love. These fit so well and were so comfortable that I went back to the store a week later and bought another pair. I have since ordered 2 more pairs.I wear a US size 9 regularly and the size 40 in Naot fits me in every style I\\'ve tried on, so I am unclear why other reviewers who wear a 9 found the Rongo to fit poorly. Must be the shape of their foot because I could wear the Rongo with no breaking-in period I can wear them all day, with or without hose/footies. The Rongo style is part of the same collection as the Matai, the Koru collection, so it\\'s obvious that this style fits me well. They are comfortable, offer excellent support, and the benefits of no aching feet, ankles, knees, hips, or back really make Naot shoes worth the extra money. In the past, I have purchased plenty of cheaper shoes from discount stores and large retail chains - most of them cause my feet to ache after a couple of hours. Not so with Naot they are my go-to shoe for traveling, working, running errands...every day.The fishnet/black color in the Rongo is ultra cute and chic I get multiple compliments on these shoes EVERY time I wear them. The toe box is particularly attractive with its unusual design, and the contrast of materials really makes a fun fashion statement. Same is true for the quartz and the metal leather colors the colors and unique pattern are so fun! The adjustable Velcro strap makes for easy on/off and a good fit.Read more\",\"title\":\"Loving my Naot Rongos!\",\"username\":\"Bibliophile\"},{\"date\":\"2013-07-08T00:00:00Z\",\"dateAdded\":\"2015-12-02T00:20:28Z\",\"dateSeen\":[\"2015-12-10T00:00:00Z\"],\"sourceURLs\":[\"http://www.amazon.com/Naot-Womens-Rongo-Shiraz-Leather/dp/B0072KZT1Q\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Naot-Womens-Rongo-Leather-Patent/dp/B00S7DP958\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Naot-Womens-Rongo-Shiraz-Leather/dp/B0072KZSN0\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Naot-Womens-Rongo-Black-Flats/dp/B00TQ8ZJX0\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Naot-Womens-Rongo-Shiraz-Leather/dp/B0072KZTKW\",\"http://www.amazon.com/Naot-Womens-Shiraz-Patent-Rongo/dp/B0072KZT1Q\"],\"text\":\"I\\'m a hairstylist and unfortunately have a tailors bunion.

They\\'re a bit more expensive than I typically spend on shoes, but I took the risk, and for the sake of safety, I ordered the size I SHOULD wear (6.5) and extra wide (E). I was nervous that they would run narrow like most athletic shoes, but when they got here, they were the MOST COMFORTABLE pair of shoes I\\'ve ever worn!! I normally hate wearing shoes and prefer to be barefoot or in cheap flip flops, but I LOVE these shoes!! I\\'ve had them for quite some time now and wear them on a regular basis and they have stayed in awesome shape. Normally, my shoes start to wear around the toe box, but these are still like new. Of course, I don\\'t wear them for yard work or ranch work, but around town, to the gym, shopping, etc. ... they\\'re still amazing!!

I am a sixty-two year old woman who walks 5-7 miles daily, sometimes a little more and occasionally a little less (if my feet are aching). I tend to get a few more aches and pains than when I was younger and sometimes I get aches and pains in my feet, probably because I walk so much. I have had a few broken bones in my feet and wrists, but no really severe broken bones, so I am not sure if that is a contributing factor, or just that I am getting older and walk so much. Some mornings I do wake up with stiffness in my hands, so I may have some minor arthritis due to having had broken bones in the past. I had been wearing the Merrell Moab shoes, which worked well for a while, though they were heavy. Then, I got a knot on the bottom of my foot in the arch area and also a pain on the top of my foot down the left side. I decided to go back to a lighter pair of shoes. In the past I had worn some very lightweight Merrell running shoes which were very comfortable, but I did tend to get a callous area on the outer edge of one of my feet on the side where my little toe is. I went to Dick\\'s and saw the Nike Flyknit 4.0 shoes and tried them on and instantly loved them. The knit material on the top of the shoe hugs and conforms to your foot giving support but is not at all constrictive. Nowhere does the shoe rub against the skin so it is a shoe that is not blister causing. The bottom of the shoe is very flexible and bends with your foot but also has very good arch support, or does for my foot anyway. I bought the pair at Dick\\'s and paid 20.00 more for them than these shoes cost. They relieved my foot pain instantly when I started wearing them.
