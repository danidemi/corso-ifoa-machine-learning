Although these are a novelty shoe, they are not heavy and they actually have a real good arch in them. They are waterproof so you can splash around in puddles if you want lol and it won't effect the lights. These are pretty awesome as I had never seen anything like them. Lots of different colors and modes. It can just be a constant color, or flashing and also fading in and out. The only con I seen with them is that the color can change and one shoe is one color and the other shoe is a different color but its still cool. I also think that they are great for when bike riding or walking at night. You are safer because people can see you easily.

When I tracked my order it said it would be ship to my home at 8:00pm, instead it came way earlier than that like at noon which was awesome. Besides that people been loving my shoes everywhere I go. On a full charge they stay lit up for 10 hours which is also good. Everybody will stop and ask me where I got them from or just stop me to give me a compliment. My job is a fundraising company we deliver cookie dough to elementary schools and the kids will go crazy when they see my shoes. Overall I'm very satisfied, and even with the shoes not lit up they still look cool. I've ordered the metallic silver ones and they look so good in the dark or night time. Highly recommend these over any other light up shoes on Amazon. I've had a previous light up shoe but the charger broke and sometimes they battery would come out on the inside of the soles. But with these new shoes I don't have that problem. Simple advice I would be careful plugging them up and unplugging them because the charger port can easily break which leaves you with 2 wires. And try not to jump in these shoes, one of the lights on the bottom may not light up anymore. As long as you do that your shoes will light up just fine"", ""Bought this for my daughter.

How can the 10 and 10.5 all have the same Euro and Japan sizing - but WHY are NONE of them the size 11 I ordered. The boxes are not labeled, so I can't compare it the box packaging. They're in a plain brown box. You can see in the photo I added to the review, two different labels, for two shoes for the right foot.

Definitely get a lot of looks in these. They have a bunch of modes like flashing, strobes, and color changing. Took a while to ship but they are coming from China so patience is a virtue.

When I received these I was shocked to find that the shoes have a good arch in them! Many novelty type shoes are very flat and generally uncomfortable, but these are built like walking shoes. The padding goes from one end to the other which is a plus too! These remind me a lot of the Reebok brand with the style, padding and stitching. Where you are able to recharge the shoes is a USB cable located on the left side of the tongue. This landed just above my ankle and it wasn't bothersome at first, but eventually started to rub a little bit. If you are planning to wear these all days I suggest a piece of mole skin or padding over that piece. These shoes DO run small. I wear a 10 and my toes were cramped. I would recommend getting a full size larger.The LED lights on here are unlike the motion activated shoes you normally see, these you customize and can always stay on. They are bright and illuminate the entire bottom of the shoe. The different light modes are what gives these shoes the wow factor! You can cycle through the colors and light modes of the shoe by using the switch on the side of the USB in the shoe. You can even press that area of the shoe from the outside and access it that way (see video). Thanks for watching! These shoes were given to me as a sample in return for this honest review."", ""Love it! These shoes are surprisingly comfortable and lots of fun. I typically wear between a women's 7-8, so the 7.5 fits quite well. Changing the colors is super easy and natural as you just push the button on the side of the shoe. My only complaint is that sometimes the colors change automatically to the next mode depending on how you walk because the button is hidden towards the top of the laces, right around the top of my foot. It's not a big deal, but if you have one shoe flashing and the other one not it can be a bit annoying. The laces are also a bit flimsier and cheaper looking than I expected, but not a big deal. These shoes would look great with colorful laces as well.These shoes look GREAT in the dark and the LED are super bright and colorful. Definitely a conversation starter and perfect for parties.

I liked those shoes because they gave me a lot of support in the ankle. K-Swiss constantly cheapened the product each year. For example the padding on the inside of the shoe at the very back got thinner and thinner and would wear out quickly. These new shoes from K-Swiss are very different. The first thing I noticed is they are incredibly light (the Ultrascendor was quite heavy). The quality of the leather is very good (quite soft). There is a very good rubber toe cap. I would like more ankle support in this shoe. I do not use this shoe to play tennis and do not believe it would give me the support in the ankle that I would need. However for an every day shoe and for a walking shoe, I am satisfied. I hope to see the Ultrascendor and I wish companies would not constantly cheapen their hit products.']"

In the second month of use, the sole separated from the rest of the shoe in the toe area. It would be cute if I wanted a shoe puppet but as shoes they are now unwearable. They have lived in my trunk ever since that day. I hope to one day buy some shoe glue and put it back together like Converse should have done in the first place.']"
